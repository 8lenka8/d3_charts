The massive piece of kit for Statoil’s flagship North Sea field has now been moved out of the North Sea Hall in Haugesund, Norway, and onto the barge that will carry the module to Klosterfjorden later this month.  There it will be connected with the other two modules, which will comprise the drilling platform for the Johan Sverdrup field.  Work on the module in Haugesund started in February 2016 when the first steel was cut.  Just one and half year later, the approx. 8,000 tons module is complete.  It was a proud moment for construction manager Bjørn Pedersen, when the module was rolled out into the day light.  He said: “An enormous effort has been put into this. It has been a privilege to work with so many qualified people. We have a unique expertise, and everyone involved has played an important part in reaching yet another milestone on time.”  There were only ten centimeters’ clearance from the top of the module to the upper door casing of the North Sea Hall.

Everything went smooth and controlled without delays.  “It was nice to complete with such a good result before the many comprehensive operations that will follow in the weeks to come. This shows that the planning is good and we are on track.”  Now the module will lie alongside the quay in Haugesund, where it will be cleaned and welded onto the barge.  Two large pedestals will also be lifted on board before the module heads towards Klosterfjorden by the end of the month.  Statoil is the operator of Johan Sverdrup with a 40% stake. The other partners are Aker BP, Petoro, Maersk Oil and Lundin.  First oil is expected from the North Sea field, located 160kilometres west of Stavanger, in 2019.  1152 wheels were used to move the module.

Brønnen ligger i lisens 442, der Aker BP er operatør med en andel på 90,26 prosent. Den andre rettighetshaveren er Lotos (9,74 prosent).  Brønnen blir boret om lag 15 kilometer nord for Frøy-feltet i Nordsjøen, og dette er den sjuende brønnen som blir boret i lisensen.  Bygge ut sammen med Statoil  Statoil og Aker BP er blitt enige om å utrede to mulige utbyggingsløsninger for å få bygget ut sine mange funn i dette området, nord for Alvheim i Nordsjøen.  Det viser dokumenter petro.no har fått tilgang til.  Aker BP er operatør for funnene Frigg Gamma Delta, Langfjellet, Frøy og Fulla i det såkalte NOA-området (North of Alvheim), mens Statoil har betydelige volumer i sine Krafla- og Askja-funn.  400 millioner fat, pluss  Ifølge Oljedirektoratets faktasider dreier det seg om ressurser på rundt 400 millioner fat. I tillegg påpeker begge oljeselskapene potensial for flere funn i samme nabolag.  For å sikre at ressursene bygges ut så effektivt som mulig, har norske myndigheter pålagt selskapene å samarbeide.  Det har nå resultert i følgende to utbyggingskonsepter:  Aker BP vil være prosjektleder for studier for en felles prosesseringsplattform plassert mellom Krafla/Askja og NOA.

Brønnen ligger i lisens 442, der Aker BP er operatør med en andel på 90,26 prosent. Den andre rettighetshaveren er Lotos (9,74 prosent).  Brønnen blir boret om lag 15 kilometer nord for Frøy-feltet i Nordsjøen, og dette er den sjuende brønnen som blir boret i lisensen.  Bygge ut sammen med Statoil  Statoil og Aker BP er blitt enige om å utrede to mulige utbyggingsløsninger for å få bygget ut sine mange funn i dette området, nord for Alvheim i Nordsjøen.  Det viser dokumenter petro.no har fått tilgang til.  Aker BP er operatør for funnene Frigg Gamma Delta, Langfjellet, Frøy og Fulla i det såkalte NOA-området (North of Alvheim), mens Statoil har betydelige volumer i sine Krafla- og Askja-funn.  400 millioner fat, pluss  Ifølge Oljedirektoratets faktasider dreier det seg om ressurser på rundt 400 millioner fat. I tillegg påpeker begge oljeselskapene potensial for flere funn i samme nabolag.  For å sikre at ressursene bygges ut så effektivt som mulig, har norske myndigheter pålagt selskapene å samarbeide.  Det har nå resultert i følgende to utbyggingskonsepter:  Aker BP vil være prosjektleder for studier for en felles prosesseringsplattform plassert mellom Krafla/Askja og NOA.

The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate said it gave a permit to Aker BP to start drilling in the Lotus license area of the North Sea. The target site is about 9 miles away from the Froy field in the North Sea and will be a wildcat well for the company, one drilled in an area not previously proved to hold hydrocarbons.  This is the seventh well to be drilled in the license, the NPD said in a statement.  In its latest financial disclosure, Aker BP, a merger of Norwegian energy companies and a subsidiary of BP, raised its guidance for output this year. First quarter production was 145.3 million barrels of oil equivalent, an increase of 14.8 percent from the previous quarter. The company said it expects to produce between 135 million barrels of oil equivalent and 140 million barrels of oil equivalent per day for all of 2017, an upward revision of about 5 percent.  Elsewhere, the Petroleum Safety Authority said it gave Norwegian major Statoil consent to send a mobile drilling facility to drill and complete production wells at its Valemon field in the North Sea. Valemon holds 192 million barrels of oil equivalent, with most of that existing as natural gas.  Most of the new discoveries made offshore Norway have been in the North Sea, but the largest are in the Barents Sea.  Preliminary figures from the NPD for July show total average daily production of oil, natural gas liquids and condensate, an ultra-light form of oil, was 2 million barrels, an increase of 93,000 bpd from the previous month.

The program is funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development and could face budget cuts. Catholic Relief Services/Resilience Through Enhanced Adaptation, Action-learning and Partnership Activity  The State Departments climate team is operating on autopilot as it waits for a departmental reorganization that will likely lessen its clout.  Staff rosters are shrinking at the agencys Office of Global Change and the Special Envoy for Climate Change (SECC) office as people leave for other opportunities or are terminated under a Trump administration thats determined to make the government smaller. While those offices continue to fund climate change programs, staff members are said to be avoiding expenditures that would raise the hackles of the Trump team.  The mood is markedly different from what it was when former Secretary of State John Kerry made climate change a top departmental objective under President Obama.  I think the whole thing is in limbo until they figure out this reorganization, said Paul Bodnar, who oversaw the National Security Council under Obama.  Sources familiar with the inner workings of the State Department say the SECC office appears to still exist in a diminished form, though it could be scrapped soon. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he plans to do away with many of the special envoy posts that proliferated under Obama as part of his restructuring. That plan is due to be released by Sept. 15. The climate envoys office was never authorized by Congress, and its budget was cobbled together from the departments discretionary funds. So Tillerson has broad authority to ax it.  Advertisement  Sources say about three staff people remain in the envoys office. The former deputy special envoy, Trigg Talley, who headed the office when Trump took over, is said to have completed his rotation and is now back at his previous position directing the Office of Global Change within the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs (OES). A State Department spokesman declined to confirm current staffing arrangements.  Experts outside the department say diminished staff levels and changes to the reporting structure arent a major problem. More concerning, they say, is the potential loss of key staffers with institutional knowledge.  To me, what really matters is not how the org chart changes but rather the caliber of the people who are doing these jobs and the extent to which they understand how international climate diplomacy works, said Bodnar, who is now with the Rocky Mountain Institute.  The crew thats there now, while smaller than it was before, has moved through and contributed to the most intensive period in the history of climate diplomacy, he added, referring to its role in the Paris Agreement. So they know what theyre doing.  The two offices, which worked together throughout the Obama administration to direct U.S. participation in the United Nations climate talks and a host of other ventures, have already lost veteran staff during this years transition. Departures from the envoys office include its congressional liaison, chief of staff and a China expert.  The global change office lost key career staff to attrition and when contracts expired after Trumps January inauguration. The global change office could host the only State Department team overseeing U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement, for as long as it continues, and the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Montreal Protocol.  Dan Reifsnyder, States deputy assistant secretary for environment who co-chaired negotiations leading to the Paris deal, has also retired recently. Sue Biniaz, a former legal chief for the climate envoys office and a lead negotiator during the Paris talks, departed earlier this year. Numerous other architects of the 2015 climate deal left, as well.  Talley still standing  With all the turnover, agency alumni are relieved that Talley is still there to provide institutional memory.  With Dan gone, Trigg Talley is the most senior person left at the State Department who has worked on climate negotiations; he has tremendous integrity and the respect of his colleagues around the world as a skilled and extremely fair negotiator, said Andrew Light, a former State Department climate official whos now at the World Resources Institute.  Trumps announcement in June that the United States would depart the Paris pact wont be realized until November 2020. In the meantime, the administration has sent mixed messages about whether it will really withdraw. An agency cable was sent to U.S. diplomats this month instructing them to vaguely refer to re-engagement discussions about Paris. The same cable declares that the United States would take an active role to defend its interests in the negotiations on the Paris rulebook up until it leaves the compact.  Talley is in line to lead the U.S. delegation at a climate summit in Bonn, Germany, in November. Former State Department colleagues say hes able to defend U.S. interests in the talks — interests hes been dealing with since the Clinton administration.  Its really critical that there be that kind of expertise at State, said Biniaz.  If the Office of Global Change survives Tillersons reorganization, its mission could be trimmed by budget cuts.  The president has proposed cutting $2.3 million from OESs budget in fiscal 2018, requesting $36.8 million and 216 personnel for a bureau covering issues that range from the environment to outer space. The spending plan would also pare back funds for climate change aid and diplomacy, including formally ending the Obama-era Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI), which funded almost all climate diplomacy work at State and other agencies during the last administration.  Obamas fiscal 2017 request to Congress asked for $1.3 billion for the GCCI, which covered everything from dues for the UNFCCC and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to U.S. Agency for International Development projects meant to help poor countries cut emissions and prepare for the impacts of warming.  Yet the GCCI is a construct, not a congressionally mandated entity, and some of its work might go forward in the Trump era under a different name. The fiscal 2018 budget calls for $102.4 million for the Global Environment Facility, a fund that previously fell under the GCCI. The Trump spending plan says it benefits the U.S. economy and environment by addressing many external environmental problems that affect our domestic health, safety, and prosperity.  The spending bill by the House State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs Appropriations Subcommittee includes some money for a multilateral funding facility for biodiversity. It would also provide funds to help poor countries implement the phase-down of heat-trapping hydrofluorocarbons required under a recent amendment to the Montreal Protocol for ozone-depleting substances that the United States has yet to ratify.  Reality-based Senate?  The Senate State, Foreign Operations and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee is chaired by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a moderate on climate action. Advocates hope the panel will be more generous with funding for climate and clean energy diplomacy, even if its not labeled under the GCCI.  In terms of the leadership of that Senate Appropriations subcommittee, its reality-based, said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists. But again, its a question of where the calls get made. Do Lindsey Graham or others have complete freedom of movement on that? I dont know.  Under Obama, State used its discretionary funds to cut checks to poor nations through the U.N. Green Climate Fund. The Trump administration has ruled that out.  The continuing resolution now being used to fund the federal government doesnt bar U.S. dues being paid to the IPCC or the UNFCCC. But observers worry that future spending bills might. State says it is currently up to date on its UNFCCC dues, but there is some indication that recent contributions have been provided to a supplemental fund instead of being counted as formal dues to the climate body.  Officials from both the State Department and USAID, which implements many projects funded by the GCCI, say money allocated in the CR is still flowing to projects abroad that reduce greenhouse gas emissions or improve resilience.  We are continuing to work with various partners to implement foreign assistance programs that were funded in prior years, said a State Department official. Both USAID and State participate in oversight and management of programs previously funded through the GCCI, he noted.  A USAID spokesperson said GCCI funding in the past has been provided to country offices to use for projects and programs. The money provided under the CR is still being allocated.  Other sources say the funds are drying up or have been caught in paperwork logjams. Some describe the funding shortfalls as a victim to career staffs unwillingness to get out in front of Trump administration policy — a process slowed by the fact that numerous bureaus like OES still have no political appointees in place.  These sources say projects abroad that help poor countries may have to end unless they find more support on Capitol Hill and from leaders like Tillerson. Even with diminished budgets, the secretary of State is likely to have discretionary funds he could use for clean energy projects or sustainable development objectives, if he cares about them.  Thats the challenge, is what do Tillerson and his advisers think is supportable and advisable if they have the flexibility and the budget? said Meyer. They may be able to reorient some of those funds to different accounts if their hands arent tied by the Hill, so thats the real unknown.  In addition to USAID, funding under the GCCI has gone to support projects at the Energy Department, like U.S. participation in the Clean Energy Ministerial launched in Paris by former Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz.  It was also used by the State Departments Bureau of Energy Resources to help Morocco scale up clean energy deployment and to sponsor a CEO exchange between members of the Edison Electric Institute and utility-sector startups in Africa.

More than 90% of the country’s economy is based on oil revenue, and the civil war that erupted in December 2013 has hit the country’s economy hard. The fighting between President Salva Kiir’s troops and  loyal forces of former Vice President Riek Machar has led to most of the country’s oil fields being shut down.  South Sudan produced 260,000 barrels per day before the conflict. The country now produces about 130,000 barrels per day, almost all from Dar Petroleum facilities. The persistently low oil prices are not making things any easier. According to the International Monetary Fund, annual inflation in the east African nation has reached almost 500%. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is also expected to shrink an additional 6.1% in 2017, after contracting by 13.1% in the last year. South Sudan ranks 181 out of 188 countries in the latest United Nations Human Development Index.  ​Read Africa Energy Series South Sudan Report​ here.  Government says the country’s development will mainly rely on oil and gas, so its duty is to explore new areas, bring in new business, and get the wells producing.  In order to do this, the country is improving security and bringing the oil fields from the Sudd and Greater Pioneer operating companies back on stream. Juba, South Sudan’s capital, has even begun deploying extra security forces at the Unity Field in Block 1 and the Thar Jath Field in Block 5A. Government hopes this will help the country meet its target of 290,000 barrels per day for the 2017/2018 fiscal year.  However, government is aware that because of the difficulty of accessing facilities and a lack of investment in technology over the past four or more years, many producing sites will need new investment. Because of this, it is pinning its hopes mainly on the primary actors in the oil and gas sector, as well as operating consortia leaders – China National Petroleum Corporation, Malaysia’s state oil and gas firm Petronas, and India’s ONGC Videsh.  With around 70% of the country still unexplored, government also hopes to attract new investors. The future “holds great promise and the government is committed to creating a peaceful, pro-business, environment”, says South Sudan’s Minister of Petroleum, Ezekiel Lol Gatkuoth. The bid to attract new investors has already yielded some results: the entrance of Nigeria based Oranto Petroleum in the sector.  In March, the company signed an exploration and production sharing agreement (EPSA) with government. It is the first new EPSA to be signed since South Sudan’s independence in 2011. Oranto Petroleum has promised to invest $500 million in its exploration campaign in Block B3. The area of B3 covers 25,150 square kilometres and is considered highly prospective, with a “low risk, high reward” categorisation. The totality of Block B is 120,000 square kilometres, but it was split by the government in 2012 into B1, B2, and B3. The area also includes productive parts of the Muglad Basin.  Oranto Petroleum Chairman Prince Arthur Eze, says they will work with partners in B1 and B2 to explore the area, which has estimated reserves of more than 3 billion barrels of oil. Eze adds that the company is not deterred by the raging civil war in South Sudan. “Dealing with internal conflict is not a new challenge for oil and gas producers in Africa. Nigeria, one of the strongest oil and gas producers on the continent, is also dealing with similar problems,” he states. The country’s government has described the entrance of Oranto as an exciting development and a step in the right direction. South Sudan is looking for companies that are prepared to “move fast, innovate, exploit oil and gas resources to the fullest, and to commit over the long term,” says Gatkuoth. So far it is mainly Asian companies that are involved in South Sudan’s upstream industry. The country has not yet been able to attract investment from companies in the United States.  This is despite the fact that President Barack Obama’s administration altered the sanctions against Sudan in 2011, allowing US companies to invest in South Sudan for the first time. The government also believes that bringing in foreign companies will help boost local companies, and laws aimed at making sure that this happens are already in place.  The country’s Petroleum Act of 2012 does include provisions for local content, as well as government plans to make sure that operators and international services companies follow the law and use indigenous contractors in the fields of logistics, well services, engineering and construction, aviation, maintenance, and manpower.  South Sudan is also fast-tracking its plans to diversify export routes. Currently the country exports oil through its neighbour, Sudan. The Greater Nile Oil Pipeline is South Sudan’s sole oil export route, and it runs from Heglig field to El Bashayer port on the Red Sea in Sudan.  Juba pays Sudan $24.10 per barrel, which includes processing, transportation, and transit fees. In January of 2012, South Sudan shut down oil production after Juba accused Khartoum of siphoning oil from the pipeline. Production only resumed in 2013. Although the government plans to keep this route open, it is also looking to integrate further with its East African neighbours and share the cost of infrastructure. This includes a pipeline and road transport to Ethiopia, and a pipeline to Kenya.  Government believes the more diverse the export routes, the more the global market can depend on the delivery of South Sudanese crude. Despite being oil-rich, South Sudan imports all of its refined products by road from Kenya and Uganda, and the country often experiences fuel shortages. This is attributed to the fact that before independence, Sudan built all of the downstream oil infrastructure including storage, processing, and pipeline facilities and refineries in the north. One refinery in particular is the Khartoum refinery, which has a capacity of 100,000 barrels of oil per day.  However, Juba says it is working on changing this; in fact, in March, the government announced plans to have an oil refinery up and running within months. Construction has already started on a refinery in the Upper Nile region. Safinat Group, which is building the refinery, said it should begin production soon. A month prior, Juba announced that it had secured funding from Swiss and US sources to build a refinery, but provided no further details.  Local company Trinity Energy, which is active across the downstream spectrum, is also dusting off plans to build a 50,000-bpd capacity refinery. A feasibility study was completed in 2013, but the project stalled because of insecurity from the outbreak of civil war in December 2013. Work is now planned to commence at the end of 2017 on a refinery in the oil-producing area of Paluch, and It is scheduled to be commissioned by 2020.  The South Sudanese company says it is also considering a product pipeline to Ethiopia so that it can market its output regionally. The East African markets import finished petroleum products to the tune of nearly $12 billion annually, and the market is growing by 8 percent each year. Government says in the downstream industry, a more secure environment will positively impact the economy overall and allow it to build a more efficient system that will reduce fuel shortages.  South Sudan’s government is not only pinning its hopes on oil, but also encourages companies to explore and fully assess the country’s gas resources. One of the companies is the Nigeria-based Niger Delta E&P, which entered the country in 2015 through a joint venture with national oil company Nilepet. Nilepet has a 51% stake in the joint venture and Niger Delta has a 49% stake. The company, which has experience in gas monetization, says it is interested in gas opportunities in the east African country. Niger Delta says it finds hope in the fact that no one knows the full capacity of South Sudan’s gas resources. It is stated that the mandate of the joint venture is to monetize and commercialize the gas resources of the country.  Juba also seeks help from another African country, Equatorial Guinea, and hopes it will lend experience to the country’s upstream industry on how to make better use of gas resources. Juba’s laws prohibit gas flaring, and the wastage of national endowment will not be tolerated in the future. The Ministry of Petroleum says it will promote any new means of capturing gas and using it; it plans to get gas-to-power initiatives going urgently. Since South Sudan has a massive power deficit, Niger Delta is already looking at what the government wants, and plans to capture the flared gas and provide power from it.  The company says a feasibility study has already been conducted, and it is now moving to the implementation phase. It is also believed that the pilot power project will operate out of the same power plant that already exists at the Dar Petroleum Operating Company production facility. For now, the company plans to produce just one megawatt to prove that it can be done using available infrastructure.  Another key player in South Sudan’s oil and gas industry is the Alpha Commercial Bank- a joint venture national bank with local and international shareholders. Since current political and security climate makes financing energy ventures more expensive, the bank is critical in the development of the oil and gas sector. One duty of the bank is providing financial services to the state-owned oil company Nilepet.  Victoria Otieno, Alpha Commercial Bank’s managing director, says projects in the oil and gas sector require millions or billions of dollars in financing. For those projects, the bank looks at private equity firms and other private funds that are interested in a project, and approach them for lending. For larger upstream projects, the bank looks for private equity partners. Alpha Commercial Bank has recently been in talks with private equity firms in the Middle East.  Despite the ongoing conflict, Otieno believes it is the right time for investors who are looking at coming into South Sudan. She believes that there are a lot of opportunities in different sectors; however, the UAP Insurance company says government needs to assure investors that their businesses are secure. The company which covers the general insurance risks for Dar Petroleum Operating Company, Greater Pioneer Operating Company, and Sudd Petroleum Operating Company, says the civil war makes it difficult for insurance partners to support political and terrorism covers, as these are not risks, but realities.  The Veterans Security Services company also has a similar message for government. It states that South Sudan has a huge potential, but everything revolves around security. Additionally, if security can be improved, then the country is likely to attract new investors. Warrior Security Insight company, which offers manned guarding, technical security solutions, and risk management services, says that South Sudan remains open for business; several companies continue to operate in the country despite the conflict.

(Reuters)  JOHANNESBURG: South African engineering and construction group Murray & Roberts reported a 59 percent fall in full-year earnings on Wednesday due to losses in its Middle East business and a settlement with the South African government.  The firm, which sold its infrastructure and building business in April, said diluted headline earnings per share (HEPS) from continuing operations, which include the Middle East business, fell to 72 cents for the year to June 30 from 178 cents the year before.  This was due to a 570 million rand ($43.2 million) loss in the Middle East and a 170 million rand deal with the South African government to contribute to an industry training fund.  Excluding the Middle East business, HEPS rose 8 percent, Murray & Roberts (M&R) said.  The company in May announced plans to dispose of its Middle East business after selling its infrastructure and building unit to Firefly Investments as it shifts its focus to the global natural resources sector.  “Close-out of the business in the Middle East continues to present major risk, but all known project losses have been fully provided for in financial year 2017,” M&R said in a statement.  Under CEO Henry Laas, who has championed M&R’s expansion into the liquefied natural gas, metals and minerals and power markets as a means of boosting revenues, the group will complete its restructuring in the year to June 2018, it said.  At 1531 GMT, its shares were down 4.34 percent at 13.68 rand.

The Executive Director of Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN), Dr. Godwin Uyi Ojo, said this in an interview in Benin City, Edo State, at the weekend.  In his words: “There is steady transition from fossil fuel dependency to renewable sources of energy. Nigeria and other countries will be caught napping if they don’t develop a renewable energy hub in West Africa.  “Surprisingly, the Federal Government budgeted over N19b for ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) to buy generators and fuel. But N19b can generate huge amount of renewable energy that Nigeria can start from.  “There is no budget line for renewable energy but there is a budget for maintaining the old system. Nigeria is not thinking of energy transition and when we signal leave the oil in the soil, we are talking about Nigeria beyond oil.”  He told The Guardian that he had been campaigning for ‘leave the oil in the soil’ in the last two decades for several reasons, saying Nigeria would have been a better country if government had paid greater attention to harnessing its abundant resources from the 1960s.  He regretted that Nigeria is now a net importer of food, furniture, egusi soup, ogbono soup, garri, palm oil and so on, insisting: “We have misplaced our priorities and the rental states that depend solely on oil has been responsible for the state of our economy.”  He argued that although Nigerians may point to some of the infrastructure that were built from oil proceeds, the monumental damage done to the environment, the conflicts that have emanated from the communities and the political arena, as well as the killings in the country from the 1960s followed the do or die politics to ensure control of the oil.  “People seek political offices to control the oil resources. So, Nigeria has misplaced its priorities since the discovery of oil. That is why we said given this conflict and situation surrounding oil over the years, let us leave the oil in the soil,” he added.  Ojo said he had been clamouring for ‘leave the oil in the soil’ because it is an exhaustible resource and as such the country should begin to plan its economy as if oil does not exist.

You will see a transition from fossil fuel dependency to renewable sources of energy.”",287584269,2017-08-21 04:12:00,"Government s neglect of renewable energy regrettable  says activist *** Government s neglect of renewable energy regrettable says activist  Guardian blog Full coverage *** Renewable Energy  Nigeria’s negligence for alternative sources of energy, particularly renewable and green energy is regrettable and something to worry about as the country continues to struggle with its economy as a result of dwindling earnings from oil and gas resources.  The Executive Director of Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN), Dr. Godwin Uyi Ojo, said this in an interview in Benin City, Edo State, at the weekend.  In his words: “There is steady transition from fossil fuel dependency to renewable sources of energy. Nigeria and other countries will be caught napping if they don’t develop a renewable energy hub in West Africa.  “Surprisingly, the Federal Government budgeted over N19b for ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) to buy generators and fuel. But N19b can generate huge amount of renewable energy that Nigeria can start from.  “There is no budget line for renewable energy but there is a budget for maintaining the old system. Nigeria is not thinking of energy transition and when we signal leave the oil in the soil, we are talking about Nigeria beyond oil.”  He told The Guardian that he had been campaigning for ‘leave the oil in the soil’ in the last two decades for several reasons, saying Nigeria would have been a better country if government had paid greater attention to harnessing its abundant resources from the 1960s.  He regretted that Nigeria is now a net importer of food, furniture, egusi soup, ogbono soup, garri, palm oil and so on, insisting: “We have misplaced our priorities and the rental states that depend solely on oil has been responsible for the state of our economy.”  He argued that although Nigerians may point to some of the infrastructure that were built from oil proceeds, the monumental damage done to the environment, the conflicts that have emanated from the communities and the political arena, as well as the killings in the country from the 1960s followed the do or die politics to ensure control of the oil.  “People seek political offices to control the oil resources. So, Nigeria has misplaced its priorities since the discovery of oil. That is why we said given this conflict and situation surrounding oil over the years, let us leave the oil in the soil,” he added.  Ojo said he had been clamouring for ‘leave the oil in the soil’ because it is an exhaustible resource and as such the country should begin to plan its economy as if oil does not exist.

(Khaled Elfiqi/Pool/European Pressphoto Agency)  Egypt is at the ideological center of the ongoing dispute between Qatar and its fellow Gulf Cooperation Council members Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Since the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, Egypt has been a bellwether for both political and economic reform in the wider Middle East and North Africa. It is also the focal point of experimental efforts of the gulf states to exercise policies of financial and political intervention. How the current GCC crisis unfolds in Egypt can tell us much about the new norms of foreign intervention ­— whether economic, political or military — in the region. How and why do GCC states support Egypt?  Well before the boycott of Qatar began in June, Egypt was a key battleground for gulf countries vying for international influence. While Qatar backed the Muslim Brotherhood, Saudi Arabia and the UAE supported the military and current regime of President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi. In an effort to shore up Egypt’s political stability since its 2013 coup, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have used a number of financial tools, including deposits into the Egyptian central bank, favorable loans, in-kind donations of oil and gas shipments, and promises of foreign direct investment in sectors like real estate and agriculture. There has been some volatility in the flow of GCC financial support to Egypt over the past four years. The past year has been especially difficult for Egypt, as it sought assistance from traditional multilateral finance sources like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to address its fiscal crisis and stabilize its currency. The UAE and Saudi Arabia are turning on the support flows again to Egypt, in foreign direct investments from state-related entities, particularly in real estate. However, this foreign aid and investment is not charity, even when its target is a primary foreign policy priority. Economic statecraft, particularly from the UAE, is often funded by investment vehicles made up of the private resources of public figures, which could benefit the state and its related commercial entities. While Egypt holds a useful geographic and political position, its economic interests remain precariously divided between factions in the GCC dispute. While it is no longer indebted to Qatar for loans extended after 2011 (having made repayments in 2016 and 2014), outstanding debt payments to other gulf states will weigh heavily on its spending commitments in the coming years.  How Qatari natural gas complicates Egypt’s position Egypt also remains dependent on Qatar for its supplies of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Behind Qatar’s primary export markets in Asia and India, Egypt is a major purchaser of Qatari LNG. Egypt’s own ability to meet its energy needs has been decreasing because of both supply and financial obstacles. The reliance on natural gas became problematic in 2014, when domestic gas production fell by 22.3 percent from 2009 levels. New exploration contracts were halted after the uprisings of 2011 and 2013, as demand for electricity production surged from a growing population.  Qatar exported more than 30 percent of total global supply of LNG in 2016. Its largest customer base in the Middle East are the UAE, Egypt and Jordan. Qatar’s conflict with the UAE and Egypt now calls into question the sustainability of that commercial relationship.  Egypt’s control over the Suez Canal puts it in a powerful position to determine the flow of Qatari LNG to Europe, but it also risks Egypt’s reputation should it attempt to disrupt trade flows through the international gateway. For now, Egypt has found a middle ground, barring Qatari vessels from stopping along the way in Egypt’s ports and its economic zones, but allowing passage via the canal. If the GCC crisis were to escalate with increased commercial sanctions on Qatar and its trading partners, the economic consequences would be global. Testing austerity measures  Egypt is also a test case of some of the austerity measures the GCC states need to implement at home, though GCC states are generally much better positioned to pick and choose among structural reforms. Egypt is going through a full-fledged structural adjustment, with a fiscal deficit, inflation problem, and disincentives to foreign direct investment and tourism — its main source of foreign currency earnings. The GCC states are watching how the reduction of subsidies of wheat and gasoline will affect Egyptian society. Egypt remains a test case of how society responds to mechanisms of economic governance at the behest of a strong security state. Some scholars argue that the opportunity cost of government spending on energy consumption — in the form of subsidies — props up inefficient industries at the cost of other government portfolios. More spending on energy means less state funds are available for health and education, which make better long-term investments. Egyptians face high unemployment and obstacles to economic inclusion, especially for women. Working abroad in the GCC has been a necessary respite for many Egyptian families, though the future is uncertain for those in Qatar. For now, investment in Egypt’s political stability and economic growth remains a foreign policy priority of the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Governments and policymakers might take advantage of the learning opportunities the experimental nature of the varied economic reform agenda unfolding across the MENA region. The dispute between Qatar and the quartet including Egypt and the GCC states (Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain) is in many ways a dispute about the exercise of economic statecraft. Qatar uses its economic resources to support regional political movements from below and the opposing states support what they term secular governance with a strong overarching state. These competing visions of governance have deep pockets, sustained by aid and investment portfolios that have the capacity to reshape, and disrupt, the political economy of the entire region.

Facebook  Twitter  Google Plus  Pinterest  LinkedIn  Analysis: FRANCIS MAKASA  PRESIDENT Donald Trump this year announced the withdrawal of USA from the Paris agreement on climate change and instead wants to “renegotiate” a fairer deal that would not  disadvantage businesses and cause the country job losses, especially in the coal industries. This provoked uproar from all corners of the world and prompted France, Germany and Italy to respond by stating that the Paris deal, which has already been signed by 200 nations, is “not renegotiable”.  After so many years of painstaking negotiations, delegates to the Global Paris Summit in December 2015 agreed on measures to increase the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and ensure low greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions in a manner that does not threaten food production. USA was then represented by its ex-President Barrack Obama.  The agreement enhances the implementation of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted in New York in May 1992. It aims at strengthening the global response to climate change in the context of sustainable development and enhancing measures aimed at poverty eradication.  The highlight of the agreement is to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and enhance adaptation in a way that will limit global earth temperature increment below 2OC and to attempt to reduce it to an optimal 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.  Sub-Saharan African region together with the low-lying small island states are the most vulnerable to climate change and hence will be the worst affected by non-implementation of the Paris agreement. Yet because of the relatively low per capita use of fossil energy, sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest emissions of the GHG’s and so their contribution to climate change is negligible.  To enhance climate change mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries like those in sub-Saharan Africa, the Paris agreement has a clause to mobilise funds for such purposes. Developed countries are hence required to provide financial resources to assist developing countries in climate change adaption and mitigation.  As a result of the Paris agreement, highly industrialised countries like China, Russia and USA are obliged to scale down on industries that emit a lot of GHG’s and provide verifiable evidence of the reduced emissions of the gases on a regular basis. Therefore fossil gas industries like the old coal mines in the USA would eventually close down to reduce the deadly gas emissions. All the nations are also urged to fund initiatives that promote renewable energy sources like wind, hydro and solar.  The impacts of climate change which are mostly negative are manifested in vagaries that mostly affect agriculture and compromise food security. Since most of the sub-Saharan inhabitants depend on rain-fed agriculture for food production, climate change if unabated will continue to compromise food security in this region and condemn the rural communities to perpetual poverty.  By repudiating the Paris agreement, Donald Trump’s actions are condemning the poor countries that are the worst affected by climate change to unending poverty. Moreover, reasons Trump has advanced for the withdrawal lack merit after all. For example, Trump, who contends that the Paris agreement would cause a lot of job losses in the US coal industries, is apparently ignoring the fact that USA has in fact made immense progress since 2015 in creating employment by investing in renewable energy sources that are most likely to offset the anticipated job losses in the coal industry.  Sub-Saharan Africa and other developing countries in the world can however draw consolation from the fact that except for the USA, other developed nations are still committed to the Paris agreement. In addition, the strong institutions USA is famous for, may just rise to the occasion and convince Trump to give chance to the Paris agreement that responds to the devastating vagaries of climate change.

(bhplf) bowed to activist investors seeking a streamlining of its business by unveiling plans to sell its U.S. shale assets–acquired in a $20 billion deals spree in 2011–and delaying a multi-billion dollar investment in a Canadian potash project.The retreat from shale and potash comes after incoming Chairman Ken MacKenzie, who officially starts his job next month, held meetings in recent weeks with investors in Australia, the U.S. and the U.K. and after public concerns were raised on strategy, spearheaded by Paul Singer’s Elliott Management Corp.Melbourne-based BHP will consider options including asset sales, a demerger or initial public offering of the U.S. onshore division–the eighth-largest producer in U.S. shale fields–and has deferred a potential board decision on approving a $4.7 billion first phase of the Jansen project in Canada, the company said Tuesday in a statement.The producer’s preference is for a small number of trade sales to exit shale, Chief Executive Officer Andrew Mackenzie told analysts Tuesday on a conference call after reporting full-year profit that missed estimates. BHP’s onshore U.S. assets were free-cash flow positive in fiscal 2017 on improvements in operating and capital efficiency, BHP said.Missteps on strategy by BHP’s leadership, including in the shale unit, have destroyed about $40 billion in value, according to New York-based Elliott, which launched a public campaign seeking a range of reforms in April. BHP’s 2011 shale deals had been too costly, poorly timed and didn’t deliver the expected returns, Mackenzie said on the call.BHP has “probably picked an opportune time because we’ve seen the oil price come up from a bottom and the cycle looks firmer than it did 12 months ago, David Lennox, an analyst at Fat Prophets, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. They are going to get better value than they would have two years ago out of the segment.Crude oil has surged by 80 percent since hitting a 12-year low of about $26 in February 2016 as major producers agreed to cut production.

(bhplf) bowed to activist investors seeking a streamlining of its business by unveiling plans to sell its U.S. shale assets–acquired in a $20 billion deals spree in 2011–and delaying a multi-billion dollar investment in a Canadian potash project.The retreat from shale and potash comes after incoming Chairman Ken MacKenzie, who officially starts his job next month, held meetings in recent weeks with investors in Australia, the U.S. and the U.K. and after public concerns were raised on strategy, spearheaded by Paul Singer’s Elliott Management Corp.Melbourne-based BHP will consider options including asset sales, a demerger or initial public offering of the U.S. onshore division–the eighth-largest producer in U.S. shale fields–and has deferred a potential board decision on approving a $4.7 billion first phase of the Jansen project in Canada, the company said Tuesday in a statement.The producer’s preference is for a small number of trade sales to exit shale, Chief Executive Officer Andrew Mackenzie told analysts Tuesday on a conference call after reporting full-year profit that missed estimates. BHP’s onshore U.S. assets were free-cash flow positive in fiscal 2017 on improvements in operating and capital efficiency, BHP said.Missteps on strategy by BHP’s leadership, including in the shale unit, have destroyed about $40 billion in value, according to New York-based Elliott, which launched a public campaign seeking a range of reforms in April. BHP’s 2011 shale deals had been too costly, poorly timed and didn’t deliver the expected returns, Mackenzie said on the call.BHP has “probably picked an opportune time because we’ve seen the oil price come up from a bottom and the cycle looks firmer than it did 12 months ago, David Lennox, an analyst at Fat Prophets, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. They are going to get better value than they would have two years ago out of the segment.Crude oil has surged by 80 percent since hitting a 12-year low of about $26 in February 2016 as major producers agreed to cut production.

The Williams %R oscillates in a range from 0 to -100. A reading between 0 and -20 would point to an overbought situation. A reading from -80 to -100 would signal an oversold situation. The Williams %R was developed by Larry Williams. This is a momentum indicator that is the inverse of the Fast Stochastic Oscillator.  AltaGas Ltd (ALA.TO) currently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -59.56. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal.  The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a widely used technical momentum indicator that compares price movement over time. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold. The RSI may be useful for spotting abnormal price activity and volatility. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. The normal reading of a stock will fall in the range of 30 to 70. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued.

The formula uses ROIC and earnings yield ratios to find quality, undervalued stocks. In general, companies with the lowest combined rank may be the higher quality picks.When dealing with the stock market, investors may seek to make trades that will limit regret and create a sense of pride. Often times, investors may be challenged with trying to figure out the proper time to sell winners or let go of losers. Of course, nobody wants to sell a winner if it looks like there may be more profits to be had. On the other hand, nobody wants to hold on to a loser for so long that severe losses pile up. Investors often need to assess their own appetite for risk. Some may be able to stomach large swings on a daily basis. Others may not be able to take the volatility when dealing with riskier investments. Risk decisions may be made on past outcomes, and investors who have experienced previous profits and gains may be more likely to take a bigger risk in the future. Those who have only seen substantial losses may be more risk adverse in the future.

(ATGFF) Ploutos Investing Dividend investing, dividend growth investing, growth at reasonable price, valueSummaryAltaGas stock price has trended down since the announcement of its acquisition with WGL.Its stock price has fallen further following the announcement of its Q2 earnings.The company expects to raise its dividend towards the end of the year.Share price of AltaGas (OTCPK:ATGFF) [TSX:ALA] has been trending downward since the announcement of its acquisition of WGL Holdings (NYSE:WGL). The acquisition appears to bring near-term uncertainties as it becomes difficult for investors to assess the company’s valuation. Following AltaGas’ release of its strong Q2 earnings report, its share price continues its downward trend and has reached its 52-week low almost on a daily basis at least in the last week. What is going on? Is there anything wrong? We will discuss several factors that we believe might affect AltaGas’ share price lately.  Source: GuruFocus.com WGL Acquisition History tells us that acquisitions tend to bring uncertainties. For some companies, acquisitions and mergers help to bring synergies and strengthen their competitive position, while for others, it may be a bit more difficult to assess. AltaGas’ acquisition of WGL belongs to the latter. Synergies achieved in this acquisition are difficult to assess, as both companies generally do not overlap in their region of operation. While the WGL acquisition is accretive and its future growth potential can be great, many investors believe that AltaGas paid a premium for it. In addition, the acquisition is not something investors can bite and eat right away. It appears that the easiest route for most investors is to seek other investment opportunities instead of placing money in AltaGas. As numerous comments by the SA community iterated, money left in AltaGas now is dead money until the acquisition goes through. I believe many investors are simply waiting for the events to unfold to decide whether to add to their position or not.  Rising Interest Rates Another factor that impacts AltaGas lately may be the rising interest rate environment. Do not underestimate the effect the current rising interest rate environment has on power and utilities stocks as these stocks tend to pay a decent dividend yield and are perceived as bond-like stocks. In the past 8-9 years, the low interest rate environment has attracted many conservative income investors to invest in bond-like stocks such as telecom companies, power and utility companies, and REITs. Since early and mid-June, Canada’s central bank switched to a more hawkish tone on interest rate hikes and hiked its interest rates on July 15 for the first time in five years. Although the interest rate is still low when compared to the historical average, with another rate hike expected towards the end of the year, it is not hard to imagine many of the companies’ stock prices are impacted. My guess is that as long as the 10-year Canadian bond yield stays around 2%, its impact will likely not be humongous. However, companies with lower growth rates, higher debt leverage, and higher payout ratios will likely be hit the most in a rising interest rate environment. Fortunately, none of the three applies to AltaGas. AltaGas’ payout ratio remains sustainable and its debt leverage is reasonably low. Its growth prospect can be great if the WGL acquisition goes through. However, temporary uncertainty surrounding the acquisition makes it harder for investors to assess its growth potential. To finance the acquisition, AltaGas raised C$2.5 billion through its issuance of subscription receipts with interest payment equivalent to the dividend payment of the common shares in February 2017. The idea was that once the acquisition goes through, each subscription receipt will be converted to one common share of AltaGas. There is nothing wrong with it except AltaGas is paying C$14.1 million per month on the interest payment for these subscription receipts every month. Until the acquisition goes through, many investors would consider the C$2.5 billion subscription receipt as debt-like burdens. This is another reason why its stock price trended down.  AltaGas is Selling its Non-Core Assets Following AltaGas’ Q2 earnings release, the company also announced that it plans to begin its first phase of asset disposition process. This will include large-scale, gas-fired power generation assets in California, together with non-core assets. Although management raised its 2017 EBITDA guidance, the disposition of its assets will definitely impact the company’s EBITDA in Q3 and Q4. By exactly how much is difficult to say as it depends on the closing date of the disposition and the number of assets to be sold. In addition, how much the company would receive from the sale of these assets remains difficult to assess, not to mention that there is going to be a second phase in early 2018. Finally, what if the WGL acquisition is denied by the government? The company will be unlikely to buy back its assets sold. It may have to seek other investment opportunities to recover the loss of recurring revenues. Like any investments, this will take time. What Will Happen in Q3 and Q4? While investors are concerned about many factors heading into Q3 and Q4, there are also positive news. The company raised its 2017 guidance towards low-double-digit EBITDA growth or high-single-digit FFO growth. The commercial operational date (COD) of its Townsend IIa project is expected to be in October. In addition, its North Pine link will likely reach COD by December instead of the original scheduled Q1 2018. As CEO David Harris expressed during the Q2 conference call, management is confident that there will not be a cut on its dividend as many have speculated, but instead a raise will be in place due to many of its core projects reaching COD by the end of the year. Since management expects to hike its dividend by 8-10% through 2021 and the capital required to complete its WGL acquisition, the increase may be on the low end of the guidance. Exactly how much its dividend will increase remains to be seen. Investor Takeaway The companys acquisition of WGL has created uncertainties for it in the near-term. The selling of its California gas-fired power generation assets and non-core assets in the second half of 2017 appears to be a concern for many investors as it will impact its EBITDA. However, both AltaGas and WGL are great companies, each reporting strong results in their past quarter. AltaGas even raised its 2017 guidance on EBITDA growth. With its Townsend IIa project and North Pine link expected to reach COD by October and December respectively, AltaGas Q3 and Q4 do not look gloomy. In fact, management expects a dividend increase before the end of the year.  The recent decline in its share price makes AltaGas an attractive investment with a 7.5% dividend yield. For patient investors, this may be a great entry point to add more shares. However, any investment comes with risks. Near-term declines in its share price may continue for a while. Investors should exercise caution. Overall, we believe AltaGas’ acquisition will be accretive and return value to investors in the long term.

The MACD is calculated by subtracting the value of a 26-day exponential moving average from a 12-day exponential moving average. A 9-day dotted exponential moving average of the MACD (the “signal” line) is then plotted on top of the MACD.  Taking a step further, the MACD-Histogram, which was developed by Thomas Aspray in 1986, measures the distance between MACD and its signal line (the 9-day EMA of MACD).  Like MACD, the MACD-Histogram is also an oscillator that fluctuates above and below the zero line. Aspray developed the MACD-Histogram to anticipate signal line crossovers in MACD. Because MACD uses moving averages and moving averages lag price, signal line crossovers can come late and affect the reward-to-risk ratio of a trade. Bullish or bearish divergences in the MACD-Histogram can alert chartists to an imminent signal line crossover in MACD.  When undertaking stock analysis, investors and traders may choose to view some additional technical levels. AltaGas Ltd (ALA.TO) currently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -64.55. Investors and traders may use this indicator to help spot price reversals, price extremes, and the strength of a trend. Many investors will use the CCI in conjunction with other indicators when evaluating a trade. The CCI may be used to spot if a stock is entering overbought (+100) and oversold (-100) territory.  We can also do some further technical analysis on the stock. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for AltaGas Ltd (ALA.TO) is 41.19. Many technical chart analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. The ADX is typically plotted along with two other directional movement indicator lines, the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI). Some analysts believe that the ADX is one of the best trend strength indicators available.  Interested investors may be watching the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. Williams %R is a popular technical indicator created by Larry Williams to help identify overbought and oversold situations. Investors will commonly use Williams %R in conjunction with other trend indicators to help spot possible stock turning points. AltaGas Ltd (ALA.TO)’s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R currently sits at -82.41. In general, if the indicator goes above -20, the stock may be considered overbought. Alternately, if the indicator goes below -80, this may point to the stock being oversold.  Tracking other technical indicators, the 14-day RSI is presently standing at 30.11, the 7-day sits at 28.94, and the 3-day is resting at 51.08. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is an often employed momentum oscillator that is used to measure the speed and change of stock price movements. When charted, the RSI can serve as a visual means to monitor historical and current strength or weakness in a certain market. This measurement is based on closing prices over a specific period of time. As a momentum oscillator, the RSI operates in a set range. This range falls on a scale between 0 and 100. If the RSI is closer to 100, this may indicate a period of stronger momentum. On the flip side, an RSI near 0 may signal weaker momentum. The RSI was originally created by J. Welles Wilder which was introduced in his 1978 book “New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems”.  For further review, we can take a look at another popular technical indicator. In terms of moving averages, the 200-day is currently at 31.05, the 50-day is 29.18, and the 7-day is resting at 27.68. Moving averages are a popular trading tool among investors. Moving averages can be used to help filter out the day to day noise created by other factors. MA’s may be used to identify uptrends or downtrends, and they can be a prominent indicator for detecting a shift in momentum for a particular stock. Many traders will use moving averages for different periods of time in conjunction with other indicators to help gauge future stock price action.",287584269,2017-08-22 22:14:00,"Share Spotlight on AltaGas Ltd  ALA TO   Technicals in Focus *** Share Spotlight on AltaGas Ltd ALA TO  Technicals in Focus  BVNFull coverage *** Share Spotlight on AltaGas Ltd (ALA.TO): Technicals in Focus  August 22, 2017 BVN Staff Writer  AltaGas Ltd (ALA.TO) is on trader’s radar as the shares have moved below the MACD Histogram line, indicating a bearish chart.  Shares recently touched 27.66 on a recent bid.

When undertaking stock analysis, investors and traders may choose to view some additional technical levels. AltaGas Ltd (ALA.TO) currently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -64.55. Investors and traders may use this indicator to help spot price reversals, price extremes, and the strength of a trend. Many investors will use the CCI in conjunction with other indicators when evaluating a trade. The CCI may be used to spot if a stock is entering overbought (+100) and oversold (-100) territory.  We can also do some further technical analysis on the stock. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for AltaGas Ltd (ALA.TO) is 41.19. Many technical chart analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. The ADX is typically plotted along with two other directional movement indicator lines, the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI). Some analysts believe that the ADX is one of the best trend strength indicators available.  Interested investors may be watching the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. Williams %R is a popular technical indicator created by Larry Williams to help identify overbought and oversold situations. Investors will commonly use Williams %R in conjunction with other trend indicators to help spot possible stock turning points. AltaGas Ltd (ALA.TO)’s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R currently sits at -82.41. In general, if the indicator goes above -20, the stock may be considered overbought. Alternately, if the indicator goes below -80, this may point to the stock being oversold.  Tracking other technical indicators, the 14-day RSI is presently standing at 30.11, the 7-day sits at 28.94, and the 3-day is resting at 51.08. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is an often employed momentum oscillator that is used to measure the speed and change of stock price movements. When charted, the RSI can serve as a visual means to monitor historical and current strength or weakness in a certain market. This measurement is based on closing prices over a specific period of time. As a momentum oscillator, the RSI operates in a set range. This range falls on a scale between 0 and 100. If the RSI is closer to 100, this may indicate a period of stronger momentum. On the flip side, an RSI near 0 may signal weaker momentum. The RSI was originally created by J. Welles Wilder which was introduced in his 1978 book “New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems”.  For further review, we can take a look at another popular technical indicator. In terms of moving averages, the 200-day is currently at 31.05, the 50-day is 29.18, and the 7-day is resting at 27.68. Moving averages are a popular trading tool among investors. Moving averages can be used to help filter out the day to day noise created by other factors. MA’s may be used to identify uptrends or downtrends, and they can be a prominent indicator for detecting a shift in momentum for a particular stock. Many traders will use moving averages for different periods of time in conjunction with other indicators to help gauge future stock price action.",201734,"{u'neg': 0.01600000076, u'neu': 0.879000008106, u'pos': 0.104999996722, u'compound': 0.995800018311}",0.995800018311

You have 7 days left  Thomas Auclair  August 16, 2017  If you are interested in cashing in on AltaGas’s (TSX:ALA) upcoming dividend of $0.18 you have only 7 days before the so called ex-dividend date on the Wed 23 Aug 2017. The dividend is payable on Fri 15 Sep 2017. But is this actually an interesting opportunity for dividend investors? Let’s look into that.  What is the ex-dividend date?  If you purchase a stock on or after its ex-dividend date, you will not receive the next dividend payment. Instead, the seller gets the dividend. If you purchase before the ex-dividend date, you get the dividend.  See our latest analysis for ALA  Is AltaGas (ALA) a good dividend stock?  When analysing how sound a company’s yield is, I like to first look at the their payout ratio.  Payout ratio is a measure of what portion of a company’s earnings are paid out to shareholders as a dividend. So a payout ratio of 50% means that the shareholders recieve 50c for every $1 the company earns. Likewise a payout ratio of 150% means a company cannot afford to pay their dividend with earnings and will need to dive into their cash reserves or worse debt to pay the remaining part.  AltaGas has a payout ratio of 248%, which means that the dividend is not well covered by earnings by any stretch of the imagination. Looking forward 3 years the analysts expect the dividends per share to be around $3.054 and EPS to increase to $1.84. This means shareholders should be concerned with the company’s ability to continue paying with an estimated future payout ratio of 166%.  View our latest analysis for AltaGas  The payout ratio is a strong indicator of a company’s ability to finance their dividend distribution, but I also encourage investors to look at how consistent those payouts have been over time.  If there’s one type of stock you want to be reliable, it’s dividend stocks. Although ALA’s per share payments have increased in the past 10 years, it has not been a completely smooth ride. Shareholders would have seen a few years of reduced payments in this time.  TSX:ALA Historical Dividend Yield Aug 16th 17  Currently the company yields 7.37%, which is high for a energy stock.

August 23, 2017 Kenneth Searles  Altona Energy PLC (ANR.L) are being monitored this week as the Schaff Trend Cycle levels have shown a consistent uptrend over the course of the past 5 trading sessions.  If the levels breach the key 70 level, a market reversal will be likely, according to this signal.  The Schaff indicator, created by Doug Schaff in 2008, behaves in a way like an oscillator, identifying overbought and oversold conditions in the market. These scenarios are then used to trade price reversals. A modification of the simple overbought or oversold trade setup is the addition of the 100-period exponential moving average, which is used by institutional traders as a very powerful support-resistance tool. The Stochastics oscillator is used to add confirmation to the trade entry.  Oversold values are 0 to 20 and investors might look to buy dips in up trends when the signal line crosses up from below 20 to above 20. Overbought values are 70 to 100 and investors might look to sell rallies in downtrends when the signal line crosses down from above 80 to below 80.  Taking a deeper look into the technicals, at the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Altona Energy PLC (ANR.L) is standing at 36.43. Many chart analysts believe that an ADX reading over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would suggest no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal.  What Is ADX?  The Average Directional Index or ADX. The ADX was created by J. Welles Wilder to help determine how strong a trend is. In general, a rising ADX line means that an existing trend is gaining strength. The opposite would be the case for a falling ADX line.  When getting into the markets, most investors realize that riskier stocks may have an increased potential for higher returns. If investors decide to take a chance on some of these stocks, they may want to employ some standard techniques to help manage that risk. This may involve creating a diversified stock portfolio. Mixing up the portfolio with stocks from different sectors, market caps, and growth potential, may be the right move. In general, the goal is to maximize returns in accordance with the individual’s specific risk profile. It should be obvious that no matter how well rounded the portfolio is, there are always risks in the equity markets. Having a sound plan before investing can help ease the burden of knowing that markets can sometimes do crazy things without any rhyme or reason.  Looking further at additional technical indicators we can see that the 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) for Altona Energy PLC (ANR.L) is sitting at 38.10. CCI is an indicator used in technical analysis that was designed by Donald Lambert. Although it was originally intended for commodity traders to help identify the start and finish of market trends, it is frequently used to analyze stocks as well. A CCI reading closer to +100 may indicate more buying (possibly overbought) and a reading closer to -100 may indicate more selling (possibly oversold).  Moving averages can help spot trends and price reversals. They may also be used to help find support or resistance levels. Moving averages are considered to be lagging indicators meaning that they confirm trends. A certain stock may be considered to be on an uptrend if trading above a moving average and the average is sloping upward. On the other side, a stock may be considered to be in a downtrend if trading below the moving average and sloping downward. Shares of Altona Energy PLC (ANR.L) have a 7-day moving average of 0.22. Taking a glance at the relative strength indictor, we note that the 14-day RSI is currently at 49.25, the 7-day stands at 60.76, and the 3-day is sitting at 72.83.  The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of stock price movements. The RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder, and it oscillates between 0 and 100. Generally, the RSI is considered to be oversold when it falls below 30 and overbought when it heads above 70. RSI can be used to detect general trends as well as finding divergences and failure swings.",287584269,2017-08-23 09:29:00,"Which Direction is the Schaff Signal Headed For Altona Energy PLC  ANR L   *** Which Direction is the Schaff Signal Headed For Altona Energy PLC ANR L   Melville ReviewFull coverage *** Which Direction is the Schaff Signal Headed For Altona Energy PLC (ANR.L)?

Blake Harford  August 15, 2017  Qinfu Zhang took the helm as Altona Energy Plc’s (AIM:ANR) CEO and has earned $187,000 in total compensation over the past 12 months. It is believed that a strong indicator of alignment between executive management and shareholders occurs when the majority of the CEO’s compensation is stock-based. There’s confirmation in the market, with 60% of total compensation among S&P500 CEOs, on average, comprised of stock-based incentives.  Check out our latest analysis for Altona Energy In comparison, stock-based incentives make up a smaller part of total compensation for Zhang last year, at 3.74%. A possible explanation for lower stock compensation relative to peers may be because it is linked to company performance. If the company performed poorly in the past year, Zhang’s stock compensation may be lower this year. Looking at recent earnings, ANR delivered a negative growth rate, which is surely seen as underwhelming performance. This could be the explanation behind the low stock-based reward for the CEO in the previous year. Another case that could raise some red flags is an abnormal situation in which the CEO receives a large jump in compensation, while EPS dropped in the opposite direction. This is a useful test to find significant mismatch between executive earnings and company earnings. ANR shareholders’ interests seem hardly aligned with management, given that the CEO received a 46.09% hike in the salary, while the company’s EPS dropped by -130.97%.  AIM:ANR CEO Compensation Aug 15th 17  Is ANR overpaying the CEO?  Maximum CEO Comp = (0.5% * Net Income + 0.03% * Market Cap)  Executive compensation has been a controversial subject due to its historically non-transparent nature and the influence of executive management over the board, which is set up to uphold shareholders’ interests. Changes in reporting standards have driven companies towards a more detailed disclosure of executive compensation, providing investors with substantial information to judge whether the company is overpaying. Above is a simple equation I use to determine whether the compensation of S&P500 CEOs are paid at the appropriate level compared to the rest of the market. ANR’s CEO remuneration of $187,000 is higher than what I would deem a reasonable compensation based on the equation. This is because, after I account for the company’s size and profit it made last year, Zhang still made more money than other CEOs in comparable situations. The company should have good grounds for this level of remuneration, or else shareholders are bearing too high a cost.  Conclusion  Altona Energy’s CEO had a substantial raise in his salary, while the company faced a strong downturn in earnings, indicating that there may be some misalignment between executive management’s interests and that of the broader company. Although CEO remuneration can be a useful sign for the alignment between a company’s CEO and its performance, it is certainly not sufficient to base your investment decision solely on this factor. Now that you know to keep in mind CEO compensation when putting together your investment thesis, I recommend you take a look at our latest free analysis report on Altona Energy to see ANR’s fundamentals and whether it could be considered an undervalued opportunity.

USA TODAY SportsJustin Thomas celebrates with the Wanamaker Trophy after winning the 2017 PGA Championship at Quail Hollow Club on Aug. 13.(Photo: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports)CONNECTTWEET  15  LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECHARLOTTE — Many times throughout his young career, Justin Thomas has been his own worst enemy.Much like his high-octane swing that makes him pound-for-pound the longest player in professional golf — he tips the scales at about 150 — Thomas doesn’t hold much back on the inside, either. He’s a demonstrative player with a big personality who rides the highs and lows with equal intensity, often to his own detriment as he quickly can’t shake bad moments.But with each passing tournament, Thomas, 24, has tried to tone himself down and make patience the 15th club in his bag. There was no bigger test on this front than in Sunday’s volatile final round of the 99th PGA Championship.He aced it.On an outrageous and dramatic day at the final major of the season, when five players grabbed a share of the lead and birdies and bogeys aplenty produced roars and moans whistling through the trees framing Quail Hollow, Thomas kept his wits and nerve about him to win the Wanamaker Trophy.More: Rory McIlroy says he might not play again this seasonRelated: PGA Championship: Quail Hollows Green Mile one of golfs toughest stretchesWith a 3-under-par 68, Thomas broke from the pack to win his first major championship. With rounds of 73-66-69-68, he finished at 8 under and two shots clears of Francesco Molinari (67), Patrick Reed (67) and Louis Oosthuizen (70). Another shot back was Hideki Matsuyama (72) and Rickie Fowler (67). Kevin Kisner, who held the 54-hole lead, shot 74 and fell into a tie for seventh with Graham DeLaet (69).“I just had an unbelievable calmness throughout the week, throughout the day,” said Thomas, who won $1.89 million and will move to No. 6 in the world. “I truly felt like I was going to win. I remember my girlfriend was supposed to fly out at about 7 and I was like, ‘You need to change your flight to later, because I don’t know, I just feel like I don’t want you to miss this. I feel like I’m going to get it done.’ I just was very confident. ...“I just didn’t get flustered. I felt like I kind of kept everything in front of me.”Wait for it ... wait for it ... GOT IT. #PGAChamppic.twitter.com/FUR5HciqxM— PGA of America (@PGA) August 13, 2017Jordan Spieth’s quest to become the youngest player to win the career Grand Slam never really got started. With rounds of 72-73-71-70 he finished 3 over.While Spieth had trouble on the greens, Thomas made a lot of big putts and didn’t three-putt once. Some of his best work came on the Green Mile, the 1,240-yard stretch of conflict on the last three holes. First Thomas saved par with a solid 8-foot putt on the 519-yard, par-4 16th. He gave himself a huge cushion with a birdie on the 221-yard, par-3 17th, where he rifled a 7-iron to 15 feet and buried the putt, saying the 7-iron was one of the best shots he’s ever hit.Aware of his three-shot lead on the 500-yard, par-4 final hole, Thomas played safe after driving into a fairway bunker and the closing bogey proved inconsequential.Those weren’t his only big moments. With his pace and demeanor in check from the first tee, Thomas recovered from a bogey on the first, where he made a huge 20-footer to keep from making a double-bogey. That was an energy boost and he came right back with a birdie from 16 feet on the second. He made a 36-footer for birdie on the ninth, then added another birdie from 8 feet on the 10th when the ball hung on the lip of the cup for 10 seconds before falling into the hole.He provided another heroic moment with a chip-in for birdie from 40 feet on the 13th, which gave him a two-shot lead.Waiting for Thomas off the 18th green were a bunch of 20-somethings who are keeping the youth movement in professional golf alive and well — Spieth, Fowler and Bud Cauley. Also waiting for him were his parents, Mike and Jani.Thomas is a third generation PGA professional and joined seven others who won the PGA whose fathers were PGA professionals. Thomas’ father also is his coach. His grandfather, Paul, also was a PGA professional.His parents walked every step of the way with their son this week, much like they do at most every tournament he plays. Thomas learned the game from his dad, the head professional at Harmony Landing Country Club outside of Louisville.“I mean, its the PGA Championship. Im a PGA member, my Dad’s a PGA member, and its just a special moment,” Mike Thomas said after the round. “I told him before the round, ‘You know, youre second in the field in birdies, if you make a bogey you dont need to panic. Just be smart out there, dont do something stupid.’ Once he birdied 17, I said to myself on the tee shot on 18, ‘Man, just get this thing on land somewhere. It can be in the beer stand, it doesnt matter where it is, just get it on land and make a five.’ ...“It’s really special, it’s really cool. To win is so hard, and having my dad being a PGA member and still alive, I’m sure my phone is going to be blowing up when I turn it back on.”All the feels between father and son for @JustinThomas34pic.twitter.com/aG6goo6kQe— Brian Wacker (@brianwacker1) August 13, 2017It meant a great deal to Thomas, too.“For me, the PGA definitely had a special place in my heart, and maybe a special drive,” he said. “I want to win every tournament I play in. I want to try to win every major. But the end of the day, this was really cool. For this to be my first one and have my dad here, and I know grandpa was watching at home. I was able to talk to him and that was pretty cool. It’s just a great win for the family.”The win was Thomas’ fourth of the season and his first on the U.S. mainland among his five career wins. After winning in Malaysia at the CIMB Classic for the second consecutive time last fall, he pulled off the Hawaii double, winning the Hyundai Tournament of Champions and the Sony Open, where he shot a first-round 59 and won by seven shots.He contended here and there but not much was happening for him after leaving the Aloha State. That is, until the U.S. Open, where he shot a 9-under-par 63 in the third round, the lowest round in major championship history in relation to par, and trailed by one with 18 to play. But an errant tee shot on the first knocked him for a loop, and he shot 75 to finish in a tie for ninth.But that’s where Thomas said he learned something about himself, something about the patience needed to finish off things on the biggest stages in golf.“Any time you can play and be there, you just learn little things without even knowing it. Just being patient. Just the experience of going through it, any time you can be in the final group is great,” Thomas said. “But this week it just was really my comfortability of where my game was and how I felt, and the prep that I put into this week. I felt like I was ready.It just was about going out and doing it.” FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInThis week at the 2017 PGA Championship FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

GOT IT. #PGAChamppic.twitter.com/FUR5HciqxM— PGA of America (@PGA) August 13, 2017Jordan Spieth’s quest to become the youngest player to win the career Grand Slam never really got started. With rounds of 72-73-71-70 he finished 3 over.While Spieth had trouble on the greens, Thomas made a lot of big putts and didn’t three-putt once. Some of his best work came on the Green Mile, the 1,240-yard stretch of conflict on the last three holes. First Thomas saved par with a solid 8-foot putt on the 519-yard, par-4 16th. He gave himself a huge cushion with a birdie on the 221-yard, par-3 17th, where he rifled a 7-iron to 15 feet and buried the putt, saying the 7-iron was one of the best shots he’s ever hit.Aware of his three-shot lead on the 500-yard, par-4 final hole, Thomas played safe after driving into a fairway bunker and the closing bogey proved inconsequential.Those weren’t his only big moments. With his pace and demeanor in check from the first tee, Thomas recovered from a bogey on the first, where he made a huge 20-footer to keep from making a double-bogey. That was an energy boost and he came right back with a birdie from 16 feet on the second. He made a 36-footer for birdie on the ninth, then added another birdie from 8 feet on the 10th when the ball hung on the lip of the cup for 10 seconds before falling into the hole.He provided another heroic moment with a chip-in for birdie from 40 feet on the 13th, which gave him a two-shot lead.Waiting for Thomas off the 18th green were a bunch of 20-somethings who are keeping the youth movement in professional golf alive and well — Spieth, Fowler and Bud Cauley. Also waiting for him were his parents, Mike and Jani.Thomas is a third generation PGA professional and joined seven others who won the PGA whose fathers were PGA professionals. Thomas’ father also is his coach. His grandfather, Paul, also was a PGA professional.His parents walked every step of the way with their son this week, much like they do at most every tournament he plays. Thomas learned the game from his dad, the head professional at Harmony Landing Country Club outside of Louisville.“I mean, its the PGA Championship. Im a PGA member, my Dad’s a PGA member, and its just a special moment,” Mike Thomas said after the round. “I told him before the round, ‘You know, youre second in the field in birdies, if you make a bogey you dont need to panic. Just be smart out there, dont do something stupid.’ Once he birdied 17, I said to myself on the tee shot on 18, ‘Man, just get this thing on land somewhere. It can be in the beer stand, it doesnt matter where it is, just get it on land and make a five.’ ...“It’s really special, it’s really cool. To win is so hard, and having my dad being a PGA member and still alive, I’m sure my phone is going to be blowing up when I turn it back on.”All the feels between father and son for @JustinThomas34pic.twitter.com/aG6goo6kQe— Brian Wacker (@brianwacker1) August 13, 2017It meant a great deal to Thomas, too.“For me, the PGA definitely had a special place in my heart, and maybe a special drive,” he said. “I want to win every tournament I play in. I want to try to win every major. But the end of the day, this was really cool. For this to be my first one and have my dad here, and I know grandpa was watching at home. I was able to talk to him and that was pretty cool. It’s just a great win for the family.”The win was Thomas’ fourth of the season and his first on the U.S. mainland among his five career wins. After winning in Malaysia at the CIMB Classic for the second consecutive time last fall, he pulled off the Hawaii double, winning the Hyundai Tournament of Champions and the Sony Open, where he shot a first-round 59 and won by seven shots.He contended here and there but not much was happening for him after leaving the Aloha State. That is, until the U.S. Open, where he shot a 9-under-par 63 in the third round, the lowest round in major championship history in relation to par, and trailed by one with 18 to play. But an errant tee shot on the first knocked him for a loop, and he shot 75 to finish in a tie for ninth.But that’s where Thomas said he learned something about himself, something about the patience needed to finish off things on the biggest stages in golf.“Any time you can play and be there, you just learn little things without even knowing it. Just being patient. Just the experience of going through it, any time you can be in the final group is great,” Thomas said. “But this week it just was really my comfortability of where my game was and how I felt, and the prep that I put into this week. I felt like I was ready.It just was about going out and doing it.” FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInThis week at the 2017 PGA Championship FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Aug 23, 2017  Financial News Staff  Amerisur Resources PLC (AMER.L) shares are moving today on volatility 1.59% or $0.25 from the open. The LSE listed company saw a recent bid of 16.00 and 309573 shares have traded hands in the session.  Smart investors are often very knowledgeable about the markets. Many successful investors have become highly adept at knowing when to buy and when to sell. They have also managed to control risk and secure sustained profits. This doesn’t just happen overnight. Investors often spend many years of trial and error before being able to put together the puzzle. Top investors are also able to make better investing decisions with the information at hand. With vast amounts of data readily available for everyone, it becomes more about interpreting the data rather than just receiving it. Knowing how to block out the noise and find information that is useful, can be a highly coveted skill. Turning available information into a winning portfolio is where the good investor can become a great investor.  Now let’s take a look at how the fundamentals are stacking up for Amerisur Resources PLC (AMER.L). Fundamental analysis takes into consideration market, industry and stock conditions to help determine if the shares are correctly valued. Amerisur Resources PLC currently has a yearly EPS of -2.40. This number is derived from the total net income divided by shares outstanding. In other words, EPS reveals how profitable a company is on a share owner basis.  Another key indicator that can help investors determine if a stock might be a quality investment is the Return on Equity or ROE. Amerisur Resources PLC (AMER.L) currently has Return on Equity of -14.32. ROE is a ratio that measures profits generated from the investments received from shareholders. In other words, the ratio reveals how effective the firm is at turning shareholder investment into company profits. A company with high ROE typically reflects well on management and how well a company is run at a high level. A firm with a lower ROE might encourage potential investors to dig further to see why profits aren’t being generated from shareholder money.  Another ratio we can look at is the Return on Invested Capital or more commonly referred to as ROIC. Amerisur Resources PLC (AMER.L) has a current ROIC of -13.51. ROIC is calculated by dividing Net Income – Dividends by Total Capital Invested.  Similar to ROE, ROIC measures how effectively company management is using invested capital to generate company income. A high ROIC number typically reflects positively on company management while a low number typically reflects the opposite.  Turning to Return on Assets or ROA, Amerisur Resources PLC (AMER.L) has a current ROA of -11.98. This is a profitability ratio that measures net income generated from total company assets during a given period. This ratio reveals how quick a company can turn it’s assets into profits. In other words, the ratio provides insight into the profitability of a firm’s assets. The ratio is calculated by dividing total net income by the average total assets. A higher ROA compared to peers in the same industry, would suggest that company management is able to effectively generate profits from their assets. Similar to the other ratios, a lower number might raise red flags about management’s ability when compared to other companies in a similar sector.  Investors may be trying to define which trends will prevail in the second half of the year. As the markets continue to chug along, investors may be trying to maximize gains and become better positioned for success.

Aug 23, 2017  Financial News Staff  Amerisur Resources PLC (AMER.L) shares are moving today on volatility 1.59% or $0.25 from the open. The LSE listed company saw a recent bid of 16.00 and 309573 shares have traded hands in the session.  Smart investors are often very knowledgeable about the markets. Many successful investors have become highly adept at knowing when to buy and when to sell. They have also managed to control risk and secure sustained profits. This doesn’t just happen overnight. Investors often spend many years of trial and error before being able to put together the puzzle. Top investors are also able to make better investing decisions with the information at hand. With vast amounts of data readily available for everyone, it becomes more about interpreting the data rather than just receiving it. Knowing how to block out the noise and find information that is useful, can be a highly coveted skill. Turning available information into a winning portfolio is where the good investor can become a great investor.  Now let’s take a look at how the fundamentals are stacking up for Amerisur Resources PLC (AMER.L). Fundamental analysis takes into consideration market, industry and stock conditions to help determine if the shares are correctly valued. Amerisur Resources PLC currently has a yearly EPS of -2.40. This number is derived from the total net income divided by shares outstanding. In other words, EPS reveals how profitable a company is on a share owner basis.  Another key indicator that can help investors determine if a stock might be a quality investment is the Return on Equity or ROE. Amerisur Resources PLC (AMER.L) currently has Return on Equity of -14.32. ROE is a ratio that measures profits generated from the investments received from shareholders. In other words, the ratio reveals how effective the firm is at turning shareholder investment into company profits. A company with high ROE typically reflects well on management and how well a company is run at a high level. A firm with a lower ROE might encourage potential investors to dig further to see why profits aren’t being generated from shareholder money.  Another ratio we can look at is the Return on Invested Capital or more commonly referred to as ROIC. Amerisur Resources PLC (AMER.L) has a current ROIC of -13.51. ROIC is calculated by dividing Net Income – Dividends by Total Capital Invested.  Similar to ROE, ROIC measures how effectively company management is using invested capital to generate company income. A high ROIC number typically reflects positively on company management while a low number typically reflects the opposite.  Turning to Return on Assets or ROA, Amerisur Resources PLC (AMER.L) has a current ROA of -11.98. This is a profitability ratio that measures net income generated from total company assets during a given period. This ratio reveals how quick a company can turn it’s assets into profits. In other words, the ratio provides insight into the profitability of a firm’s assets. The ratio is calculated by dividing total net income by the average total assets. A higher ROA compared to peers in the same industry, would suggest that company management is able to effectively generate profits from their assets. Similar to the other ratios, a lower number might raise red flags about management’s ability when compared to other companies in a similar sector.  Investors may be trying to define which trends will prevail in the second half of the year. As the markets continue to chug along, investors may be trying to maximize gains and become better positioned for success. Technical analysts may be studying different historical price and volume data in order to help uncover where the momentum is headed. Coming up with a solid strategy may take some time, but it might be well worth it in the long run. As we move deeper into the year, investors will be closely tracking the next few earnings periods.

The MACD is calculated by subtracting the value of a 26-day exponential moving average from a 12-day exponential moving average. A 9-day dotted exponential moving average of the MACD (the “signal” line) is then plotted on top of the MACD.  Taking a step further, the MACD-Histogram, which was developed by Thomas Aspray in 1986, measures the distance between MACD and its signal line (the 9-day EMA of MACD).  Like MACD, the MACD-Histogram is also an oscillator that fluctuates above and below the zero line. Aspray developed the MACD-Histogram to anticipate signal line crossovers in MACD. Because MACD uses moving averages and moving averages lag price, signal line crossovers can come late and affect the reward-to-risk ratio of a trade. Bullish or bearish divergences in the MACD-Histogram can alert chartists to an imminent signal line crossover in MACD.  Investors may be taking a look at some additional technical numbers on shares of Amerisur Resources PLC (AMER.L). The 14-day RSI is currently spotted at 30.00, the 7-day is at 27.37, and the 3-day is sitting at 31.53. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a widely used technical momentum indicator that compares price movement over time. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold. The RSI may be useful for spotting abnormal price activity and volatility. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. The normal reading of a stock will fall in the range of 30 to 70. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued. A reading under 30 may indicate that the stock is oversold, and possibly undervalued.  In terms of CCI levels, Amerisur Resources PLC (AMER.L) currently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -137.49. Investors and traders may use this indicator to help spot price reversals, price extremes, and the strength of a trend. Many investors will use the CCI in conjunction with other indicators when evaluating a trade. The CCI may be used to spot if a stock is entering overbought (+100) and oversold (-100) territory. The 14-day ADX is 34.72. Many technical chart analysts believe that an ADX reading over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A level under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. The ADX is typically plotted along with two other directional movement indicator lines, the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI). Some analysts believe that the ADX is one of the best trend strength indicators available.  Investors may be studying other technical indicators like the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. The Williams %R is a momentum indicator that helps measure oversold and overbought levels. This indicator compares the closing price of a stock in relation to the highs and lows over a certain time period. A common look back period is 14 days. Amerisur Resources PLC (AMER.L)’s Williams %R presently stands at -90.00. The Williams %R oscillates in a range from 0 to -100. A reading between 0 and -20 would indicate an overbought situation. A reading from -80 to -100 would indicate an oversold situation. Looking at some moving average levels on shares of Amerisur Resources PLC (AMER.L), the 200-day is at 23.30, the 50-day is 18.40, and the 7-day is sitting at 16.19. Moving averages can help identify trends and price reversals. They may also be used to help spot support and resistance levels. Moving averages are considered to be lagging indicators meaning that they confirm trends. A certain stock may be considered to be on an uptrend if trading above a moving average and the average is sloping upward. On the other side, a stock may be considered to be in a downtrend if trading below the moving average and sloping downward.",287584269,2017-08-22 23:14:00,"Taking a Deep Dive into Technical Levels for Amerisur Resources PLC  AMER L  *** Taking a Deep Dive into Technical Levels for Amerisur Resources PLC AMER L   Melville ReviewFull coverage *** Taking a Deep Dive into Technical Levels for Amerisur Resources PLC (AMER.L)  August 22, 2017 Kenneth Searles  Amerisur Resources PLC (AMER.L) is on trader’s radar as the shares have moved below the MACD Histogram line, indicating a bearish chart.  Shares recently touched 15.75 on a recent bid.

(OVL), the overseas investment arm of India’s state owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC), plans to invest US$150 million in exploration in fiscal year 2018.  Plans include drilling more wells in Colombia, where the company recently made a commercial discovery, and exploration activities in Kazakhstan and Bangladesh.  OVL, which operates Colombia’s CPO-5 Block, recently made a commercial discovery with its Mariposa-1 exploration well. OVL holds a 70%participating interest in the block and South American oil major Amerisur Resources holds the remaining 30%. Drilled to a total depth of 3,522 m (11,556 ft) in May, Mariposa-1 has been officially classified as a discovery, Amerisur said in an Aug. 9 update.  Providing technical details, Amerisur said a 7-in. production liner was successfully run and cemented in the well, and an interval of about 4 m (12 ft) at the top of about 37 m (120 ft) of net pay logged in the L3 sandstone was perforated to perform a short-term test with a drillstem test temporary string.  The well was tested in natural flow over a variety of choke sizes, with appropriate closed-in pressure buildup periods, to ascertain reservoir parameters. The natural controlled flow rate recorded was about 4,601 bbl of 40.8 degree API oil per day with a water cut of 0.35% and 348 psi flowing wellhead pressure over a 40/64-in. choke, the statement said.  The results indicated strong further production potential.  The well has been closed in following interpretation of the short-term test data. OVL is expected to present an evaluation plan, including provision for a long-term test on Mariposa, to Colombia’s Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos (ANH) in the coming weeks. Once approved, the company hopes to bring Mariposa-1 onstream in second-half 2017.  Kazakhstan  OVL has also accelerated its exploration efforts in Kazakhstan and Bangladesh.  The company has started drilling in the Caspian Sea offshore Kazakhstan as it prepares to drill in Bangladesh.  In 2011, OVL bought a 25% stake in Kazakhstan’s Satpayev oil block, paying $ 13 million to Kazakhstan. In addition, the Indian explorer paid$80 million as a one-time assignment fee to KazMunaiGas (KMG).At that time OVL committed a minimum exploration investment of$165 million and an additional optional expenditure of $235 million to the Satpayev project in Kazakhstan. Reports suggest that the company has already invested $150 million in Satpayev and will invest a total of $400 million in exploration.  The Satpayev Block, measuring 1,582 sq km (611 sq miles), is located in the North Caspian Sea in water depths between 6 m and 8 m (20 ft and 26 ft) and has two prospective areas that hold an estimated 256 million tonnes of oil and natural gas resources. It lies near four major discoveries.  OVL estimates a peak output of 287,000 barrels per day from the Satpayev and Satpayev Vostochni (East) structures.  Besides, Kazakhstan developments, OVL also plans to spud an exploratory well in shallow water offshore Bangladesh.  Bangladesh  A joint venture (JV) that comprises OVL and Oil India Ltd. (OIL) signed production-sharing contracts (PSC) for shallow-water blocks SS-04 and SS-09 in Bangladesh in August 2013. The government of Bangladesh approved the award of the blocks to OVL-OIL consortium on December 2013. Under the contract signed, OVL-OIL agreed to spend $103.2 million during the initial exploration of the two blocks.  OVL operates the 7,026-sq-km (2,713-sq-mile) Block SS-09 and holds a 45% interest in the PSC, while OIL holds 45% and state-owned Bangladesh Petroleum E&P Co. (BAPEX) holds remaining 10%. The adjacent Block SS-04 covers 7,226 sq km (2,790 sq miles).  Under the terms of the contract, the OVL-OIL JV will be allowed to operate and sell oil and gas for 20 years from an oil field and 25 years from a gas field. However, Bangladeshi law stipulates the two firms cannot sell gas outside the country and must first offer the fuel to national oil firm Petrobangla. If Petrobangla does not accept the offer within six months, the JV can sell the gas to anyone within Bangladesh.  OVL aims to increase its output by 14% to 14.37 million tonne (MT) this year, with its fields in Russia contributing half of the total. In 2016-2017, OVL produced 12.57 MT of crude oil and equivalent natural gas from its assets abroad. Currently OVL has 37 oil and gas assets in 17 countries and contributes 14.9% and 12.9% of India’s oil and natural gas production, respectively.

In 2011, OVL bought a 25% stake in Kazakhstan’s Satpayev oil block, paying $ 13 million to Kazakhstan. In addition, the Indian explorer paid$80 million as a one-time assignment fee to KazMunaiGas (KMG).At that time OVL committed a minimum exploration investment of$165 million and an additional optional expenditure of $235 million to the Satpayev project in Kazakhstan. Reports suggest that the company has already invested $150 million in Satpayev and will invest a total of $400 million in exploration.  The Satpayev Block, measuring 1,582 sq km (611 sq miles), is located in the North Caspian Sea in water depths between 6 m and 8 m (20 ft and 26 ft) and has two prospective areas that hold an estimated 256 million tonnes of oil and natural gas resources. It lies near four major discoveries.  OVL estimates a peak output of 287,000 barrels per day from the Satpayev and Satpayev Vostochni (East) structures.  Besides, Kazakhstan developments, OVL also plans to spud an exploratory well in shallow water offshore Bangladesh.  Bangladesh  A joint venture (JV) that comprises OVL and Oil India Ltd. (OIL) signed production-sharing contracts (PSC) for shallow-water blocks SS-04 and SS-09 in Bangladesh in August 2013. The government of Bangladesh approved the award of the blocks to OVL-OIL consortium on December 2013. Under the contract signed, OVL-OIL agreed to spend $103.2 million during the initial exploration of the two blocks.  OVL operates the 7,026-sq-km (2,713-sq-mile) Block SS-09 and holds a 45% interest in the PSC, while OIL holds 45% and state-owned Bangladesh Petroleum E&P Co. (BAPEX) holds remaining 10%. The adjacent Block SS-04 covers 7,226 sq km (2,790 sq miles).  Under the terms of the contract, the OVL-OIL JV will be allowed to operate and sell oil and gas for 20 years from an oil field and 25 years from a gas field. However, Bangladeshi law stipulates the two firms cannot sell gas outside the country and must first offer the fuel to national oil firm Petrobangla. If Petrobangla does not accept the offer within six months, the JV can sell the gas to anyone within Bangladesh.  OVL aims to increase its output by 14% to 14.37 million tonne (MT) this year, with its fields in Russia contributing half of the total. In 2016-2017, OVL produced 12.57 MT of crude oil and equivalent natural gas from its assets abroad. Currently OVL has 37 oil and gas assets in 17 countries and contributes 14.9% and 12.9% of India’s oil and natural gas production, respectively.

This is We Are the Seeds’ inaugural year, and anticipation for the new market and family-friendly festival is high. Tchin, a silversmith of Narragansett and Blackfoot heritage, is traveling to New Mexico from New Jersey for the event. He may well make the last leg of the journey by city bus. “Last time I was in Santa Fe I heard people saying that Railyard Park was hard to get to,” he said. “But I was looking it up online. The #2 Cerrillos route stops right at the park — at Paseo de Peralta and Guadalupe streets.”Tchin’s daughter Tailinh Agoyo is co-director of We Are the Seeds, alongside Paula Mirabal (Taos Pueblo). Together they have coordinated an art sale for about 100 artists from the United States and Canada as well as assorted demonstrations, workshops, and entertainment. Agoyo and Mirabal have impressive experience producing Native art shows. Both worked for SWAIA Santa Fe Indian Market before leaving to work on the Indigenous Fine Art Market (IFAM), which was held in Railyard Park from 2014 through 2016. They left that organization prior to the 2016 festival in Santa Fe, running an East Coast version of IFAM at the Mashantucket Pequot Museum & Research Center in Connecticut in May 2016. (IFAM hosts an indoor showcase at the Inn and Spa at Loretto on Saturday and Sunday, Aug. 18 and 19.) Agoyo and Mirabal put Seeds together at the request of the Railyard Corporation, which wanted to continue hosting a market for indigenous artists and had confidence in the pair’s ability to conceive a new show in less than one calendar year. “I’m an artist; my father is an artist; I grew up in the art world. It was a lot to take on, and when they called last August, Paula and I really had to think it over. But this is who I am,” Agoyo said. “Nine or ten months later, it’s all come together. Doing the show itself wasn’t a challenge. The challenge was to create a viable organization that is sustainable and makes sense for us.” They have established a non-profit to support the festival, We Are the Seeds of CultureTrust. The festival is supported by CultureTrust Greater Philadelphia, a charitable trust supporting diverse cultural practices in the Philadelphia region, where Agoyo now lives. Agoyo and Mirabal’s vision for the art show emphasizes the role of elders and women in art-making traditions and is welcoming of contemporary art, street styles, and forms of creative expression that collectors might not find at other Indian art markets.“We’re Native women and we have a different perspective. We wanted to create a show that was intimate, that was manageable and warm and inviting. People will have the time and space to interact with the artists, really learn about who they are and where they’re from, what their story is. We want Seeds to grow organically. We’re starting off slow so we can nurture it into what it’s supposed to be,” Agoyo said.We Are the Seeds begins on Wednesday, Aug. 16, with a sunset party in the park with DJ Brian Frejo. Musical acts appear on the Seeds stage throughout the festival; performers include Jennifer Elizabeth Kreisberg, who sang at the Women’s March in Washington, D.C., in January. With her son, Wakinyan Redshirt, Kreisberg leads a youth music workshop on Saturday, Aug. 19. Three bronze sculptures by famed Chiricahua Apache artist Allan Houser — Anasazi, Embrace, and Corngrinder — will be unveiled on Thursday, Aug. 17. The works, along with the sculptural installation Element, by Tony Lee, Allan Houser’s assistant sculptor, are on display as part of the Railyard Art Project until February 2018.The Seeds art market includes a program called Honor Women Art Share. Basket weaver Sally Black (Diné), rug weaver Leona Bia (Diné), and potter Brenda Hill (Tuscarora/Choctaw), join painter and doll maker Dawn Spears (Narragansett/Choctaw) and painter J. Nicole Hatfield (Comanche and Kiowa) in presenting ongoing demonstrations of their work at their booths. Spears, who is Hill’s sister, will demonstrate how to create custom-painted Converse Chuck Taylor All-Stars. Spears also leads youth art workshops in shoe painting on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.“I am always looking for ways to wear our art, different ways for us to show our expression,” Spears said. She insisted that even children who do not consider themselves creative should come draw on shoes with her. She lives in Rhode Island and heads the Northeast Indigenous Arts Alliance. She worked with Agoyo and Mirabal on IFAM East and is producing the 2018 Indian Market for the Abbe Museum in Bar Harbor, Maine. She grew up in an artistic household and learned to draw at an early age. “I always had a sketchbook,” she said. Her mother kept her stocked with art supplies, even after she got married and moved away.Though her custom shoes are growing in popularity, Spears is probably best known for her corn-husk dolls. She got into making dolls when she was about twenty years old. “My mother was a potter but she did whatever kind of art she felt like at any given moment, so you never knew what was going to be her next thing. She told me to focus on one thing and not dabble like she did, so I started making dolls and that’s one thing that I’ve continued right along. I love making them. Sometimes it will take me a year to make a doll and then it’s really hard for me to part with it because it becomes a part of me. I made a doll for a friend’s daughter and that doll came with me when I was working. I took it all over — I think I even took it to Peru. When I finally gave it to the person it was intended for, I told her that this doll has traveled.”Seeds marks the first occasion when Spears will be in Santa Fe with her sister. She is excited to be a part of the Honor Women program with Hill and excited about the Seeds festival in general, because it gives her the opportunity to show in Santa Fe, where indigenous art is often defined by what collectors see at SWAIA Indian Market. “I don’t feel like I could ever get into SWAIA because I’m not doing anything that fits under that umbrella,” she said. “Seeds gives someone like me an opportunity. The difference with Seeds is that this is Native artists and Native people producing the event instead of collectors, so it’s a whole different framework.”Seeds also highlights the importance and contributions of legacy artists — elders who have been participating in Indian art markets for decades and who have depended on these sales to support their families. “They are our foundation,” Mirabal said. “The things they made that they considered utilitarian are part of the art world now, and they’ve been going to Market since the trains first came to New Mexico. This is our way of honoring the older artists who have been part of the art world for all these many years.”Legacy artists include Tchin and Sally Black as well as Tesuque Pueblo potter, writer, and artist Bea Duran; sister potters Carmel Lewis Haskaya and Dolores Lewis Garcia from Acoma Pueblo; and Acoma Pueblo potter Sharon Lewis, as well as her son Eric Lewis and granddaughter Tehya Davis. “It is Native American tradition to take care of our elders who took care of us in our youth,” said Tchin, who is seventy-one. “Even if we’ve moved on in terms of design or in terms of our cultural ideas, we still need to respect and honor the people who came before us. Just because we’re old doesn’t mean we don’t have more to contribute and more to think about. As artists, we want to show our work and make a living — it doesn’t matter if it’s SWAIA or Seeds or the Houston art show. These art shows might be different in their philosophies, but they are all platforms for us to get together and show and sell our work.”Tchin’s jewelry designs are based on traditional stories, “what people call legends and myths,” he said. “I call them lessons because they teach us so much. I base my work on that kind of stuff, and when I show you a piece of my jewelry, I explain it to you. I tell you the reason why I made it, what it represents.” He worries that younger artists do not always understand the importance of symbolism and the ideas of the past. “It might be beautiful, but what does it mean? The elders understand the past; we understand what people have told us.”At thirty-four, J. Nicole Hatfield is the youngest artist included in the Honor Women program. The self-taught painter from Apache, Oklahoma, has previously showed her work at IFAM. “When I found out about Seeds — that it was women forming that — I thought that was even better,” she said. “I’m so excited to meet new people and see all the artists. I’d rather go look at their work all day than be at my booth.”Hatfield started painting when she was fifteen. “I struggled with depression and suicide, and so that was my way of getting all of those emotions out and being able to heal myself. Painting is therapeutic.” She works full-time to support her family and she commits equal time to her artwork, so if she is at home, she is most likely in her studio. Hatfield’s large, bold work is inspired by the faces of tribal women from the past. Though she has dabbled in printmaking and other mediums, she finds it hard to tear herself away from painting long enough to devote time to other pursuits. The only additional discipline she pines for is silversmithing, inspired by her memories of her grandmother’s large collection of silver and turquoise jewelry. The women in her family tended toward textiles and beadwork, and though she is the only one who became part of the fine-art world, she said, her uncles and cousins are all creative and talented as well. Because painting helped her so much when she was a teenager, Hatfield tries to inspire younger artists by showing them a modern aesthetic through demonstrations and workshops.“I want to keep art traditions alive,” she said. “I am attracted to graffiti and street styles, and those are the styles kids are attracted to. Sometimes I try to incorporate words in the Comanche and Kiowa languages into my pieces. I originally did that so that I could learn and remember a word, but it went from there to wanting to encourage the youth to learn a language.”  Were Native women and we have a different perspective. We wanted to create a show that was intimate, that was manageable and warm and inviting. — Tailinh Agoyo  We Are the Seeds: Art + Culture + Fun  All events take place at Railyard Park (740 Cerrillos Road).

She insisted that even children who do not consider themselves creative should come draw on shoes with her. She lives in Rhode Island and heads the Northeast Indigenous Arts Alliance. She worked with Agoyo and Mirabal on IFAM East and is producing the 2018 Indian Market for the Abbe Museum in Bar Harbor, Maine. She grew up in an artistic household and learned to draw at an early age. “I always had a sketchbook,” she said. Her mother kept her stocked with art supplies, even after she got married and moved away.Though her custom shoes are growing in popularity, Spears is probably best known for her corn-husk dolls. She got into making dolls when she was about twenty years old. “My mother was a potter but she did whatever kind of art she felt like at any given moment, so you never knew what was going to be her next thing. She told me to focus on one thing and not dabble like she did, so I started making dolls and that’s one thing that I’ve continued right along. I love making them. Sometimes it will take me a year to make a doll and then it’s really hard for me to part with it because it becomes a part of me. I made a doll for a friend’s daughter and that doll came with me when I was working. I took it all over — I think I even took it to Peru. When I finally gave it to the person it was intended for, I told her that this doll has traveled.”Seeds marks the first occasion when Spears will be in Santa Fe with her sister. She is excited to be a part of the Honor Women program with Hill and excited about the Seeds festival in general, because it gives her the opportunity to show in Santa Fe, where indigenous art is often defined by what collectors see at SWAIA Indian Market. “I don’t feel like I could ever get into SWAIA because I’m not doing anything that fits under that umbrella,” she said. “Seeds gives someone like me an opportunity. The difference with Seeds is that this is Native artists and Native people producing the event instead of collectors, so it’s a whole different framework.”Seeds also highlights the importance and contributions of legacy artists — elders who have been participating in Indian art markets for decades and who have depended on these sales to support their families. “They are our foundation,” Mirabal said. “The things they made that they considered utilitarian are part of the art world now, and they’ve been going to Market since the trains first came to New Mexico. This is our way of honoring the older artists who have been part of the art world for all these many years.”Legacy artists include Tchin and Sally Black as well as Tesuque Pueblo potter, writer, and artist Bea Duran; sister potters Carmel Lewis Haskaya and Dolores Lewis Garcia from Acoma Pueblo; and Acoma Pueblo potter Sharon Lewis, as well as her son Eric Lewis and granddaughter Tehya Davis. “It is Native American tradition to take care of our elders who took care of us in our youth,” said Tchin, who is seventy-one. “Even if we’ve moved on in terms of design or in terms of our cultural ideas, we still need to respect and honor the people who came before us. Just because we’re old doesn’t mean we don’t have more to contribute and more to think about. As artists, we want to show our work and make a living — it doesn’t matter if it’s SWAIA or Seeds or the Houston art show. These art shows might be different in their philosophies, but they are all platforms for us to get together and show and sell our work.”Tchin’s jewelry designs are based on traditional stories, “what people call legends and myths,” he said. “I call them lessons because they teach us so much. I base my work on that kind of stuff, and when I show you a piece of my jewelry, I explain it to you. I tell you the reason why I made it, what it represents.” He worries that younger artists do not always understand the importance of symbolism and the ideas of the past. “It might be beautiful, but what does it mean? The elders understand the past; we understand what people have told us.”At thirty-four, J. Nicole Hatfield is the youngest artist included in the Honor Women program. The self-taught painter from Apache, Oklahoma, has previously showed her work at IFAM. “When I found out about Seeds — that it was women forming that — I thought that was even better,” she said. “I’m so excited to meet new people and see all the artists. I’d rather go look at their work all day than be at my booth.”Hatfield started painting when she was fifteen. “I struggled with depression and suicide, and so that was my way of getting all of those emotions out and being able to heal myself. Painting is therapeutic.” She works full-time to support her family and she commits equal time to her artwork, so if she is at home, she is most likely in her studio. Hatfield’s large, bold work is inspired by the faces of tribal women from the past. Though she has dabbled in printmaking and other mediums, she finds it hard to tear herself away from painting long enough to devote time to other pursuits. The only additional discipline she pines for is silversmithing, inspired by her memories of her grandmother’s large collection of silver and turquoise jewelry. The women in her family tended toward textiles and beadwork, and though she is the only one who became part of the fine-art world, she said, her uncles and cousins are all creative and talented as well. Because painting helped her so much when she was a teenager, Hatfield tries to inspire younger artists by showing them a modern aesthetic through demonstrations and workshops.“I want to keep art traditions alive,” she said. “I am attracted to graffiti and street styles, and those are the styles kids are attracted to. Sometimes I try to incorporate words in the Comanche and Kiowa languages into my pieces. I originally did that so that I could learn and remember a word, but it went from there to wanting to encourage the youth to learn a language.”  Were Native women and we have a different perspective. We wanted to create a show that was intimate, that was manageable and warm and inviting. — Tailinh Agoyo  We Are the Seeds: Art + Culture + Fun  All events take place at Railyard Park (740 Cerrillos Road).

The Williams %R oscillates in a range from 0 to -100. A reading between 0 and -20 would point to an overbought situation. A reading from -80 to -100 would signal an oversold situation. The Williams %R was developed by Larry Williams. This is a momentum indicator that is the inverse of the Fast Stochastic Oscillator.  Athabasca Oil Corp (ATH.TO) currently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -33.47. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal.  The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a widely used technical momentum indicator that compares price movement over time. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold. The RSI may be useful for spotting abnormal price activity and volatility. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. The normal reading of a stock will fall in the range of 30 to 70. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of stock price movements. The RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder, and it oscillates between 0 and 100. Generally, the RSI is considered to be oversold when it falls below 30 and overbought when it heads above 70. RSI can be used to detect general trends as well as finding divergences and failure swings.  At the time of writing, Athabasca Oil Corp (ATH.TO) has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -49.48. Developed by Donald Lambert, the CCI is a versatile tool that may be used to help spot an emerging trend or provide warning of extreme conditions. CCI generally measures the current price relative to the average price level over a specific time period. CCI is relatively high when prices are much higher than average, and relatively low when prices are much lower than the average. Investors may be watching other technical indicators such as the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. The Williams %R is a momentum indicator that helps measure oversold and overbought levels. This indicator compares the closing price of a stock in relation to the highs and lows over a certain time period. A common look back period is 14 days.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of stock price movements. The RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder, and it oscillates between 0 and 100. Generally, the RSI is considered to be oversold when it falls below 30 and overbought when it heads above 70. RSI can be used to detect general trends as well as finding divergences and failure swings.  At the time of writing, Athabasca Oil Corp (ATH.TO) has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -49.48. Developed by Donald Lambert, the CCI is a versatile tool that may be used to help spot an emerging trend or provide warning of extreme conditions. CCI generally measures the current price relative to the average price level over a specific time period. CCI is relatively high when prices are much higher than average, and relatively low when prices are much lower than the average. Investors may be watching other technical indicators such as the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. The Williams %R is a momentum indicator that helps measure oversold and overbought levels. This indicator compares the closing price of a stock in relation to the highs and lows over a certain time period. A common look back period is 14 days. Athabasca Oil Corp (ATH.TO)’s Williams %R presently stands at -69.23. The Williams %R oscillates in a range from 0 to -100. A reading between 0 and -20 would indicate an overbought situation. A reading from -80 to -100 would indicate an oversold situation.",201734,"{u'neg': 0.0419999994338, u'neu': 0.865999996662, u'pos': 0.0920000001788, u'compound': 0.987999975681}",0.987999975681

Created by Thomas Aspray in 1986, the MACD Histogram is a visual indicator of the difference between the MACD line and the Signal line, which is a default 9 period ema of the MACD line. The histogram is an oscillator that moves above and below the zero line, just as the MACD line does. Keep in mind when using this oscillator, that it takes four mathematical steps from price itself to create the 4th derivative, the histogram: Price => two ema averages => MACD line = Signal line => Histogram. Which means it lags price quite a bit. But like all derivatives of price, it’s much smoother than price itself.  If the MACD is above zero it helps confirm an uptrend; below zero and it helps confirm a downtrend. Zero line and Signal line crossovers are used as trade signals to enter and exit trending trades. Losing trade signals occur when crossovers occur in rapid succession due to choppy price action. Divergence shows when momentum is slowing, but it doesn’t indicate when a reversal will occur (if it occurs). Combing different elements of each strategy makes the indicator more useful, such as taking buy signals following a bullish divergence. Using price and trend analysis will aid in determining which signals to take, such as only taking buy signals when a long-term uptrend is in place.  When undertaking stock analysis, investors and traders may choose to view some additional technical levels. Athabasca Oil Corp (ATH.TO) currently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -49.48. Investors and traders may use this indicator to help spot price reversals, price extremes, and the strength of a trend. Many investors will use the CCI in conjunction with other indicators when evaluating a trade. The CCI may be used to spot if a stock is entering overbought (+100) and oversold (-100) territory.  We can also do some further technical analysis on the stock. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Athabasca Oil Corp (ATH.TO) is 24.20. Many technical chart analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. The ADX is typically plotted along with two other directional movement indicator lines, the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI). Some analysts believe that the ADX is one of the best trend strength indicators available.  Interested investors may be watching the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. Williams %R is a popular technical indicator created by Larry Williams to help identify overbought and oversold situations. Investors will commonly use Williams %R in conjunction with other trend indicators to help spot possible stock turning points. Athabasca Oil Corp (ATH.TO)’s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R currently sits at -69.23. In general, if the indicator goes above -20, the stock may be considered overbought.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is an often employed momentum oscillator that is used to measure the speed and change of stock price movements. When charted, the RSI can serve as a visual means to monitor historical and current strength or weakness in a certain market. This measurement is based on closing prices over a specific period of time. As a momentum oscillator, the RSI operates in a set range. This range falls on a scale between 0 and 100. If the RSI is closer to 100, this may indicate a period of stronger momentum. On the flip side, an RSI near 0 may signal weaker momentum. The RSI was originally created by J. Welles Wilder which was introduced in his 1978 book “New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems”.  For further review, we can take a look at another popular technical indicator.

The Tenkan-Sen is generally used in combination with the Kijun-Sen to create predications of future momentum. A buy signal is created when the Tenkan-sen line moves above the Kijun-Sen, while a sell signal is created when the Tenkan-Sen line moves below the Kijun-Sen line.  Many technical traders use the Tenkan-Sen as a tool for predicting levels where the price of the asset will find short-term support.  When reading Ichimoku Kinko Hyo charts, investors should note that the Tenkan-Sen line leads the Kijun-Sen, and tracks price with more sensitivity because it covers a shorter period of time. When the Tenkan-Sen line crosses and moves above the Kijun-Sen line, this is generally considered a bullish signal. Alternatively, when the Tenkan-Sen line crosses below the Kijun-Sen line, it is considered a bearish signal.  The tenkan sen/kijun sen cross is one of the most traditional trading strategies within the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo system. The signal for this strategy is given when the tenkan sen crosses over the kijun sen. If the tenkan sen crosses above the kijun sen, then it is a bullish signal. Likewise, if the tenkan sen crosses below the kijun sen, then that is a bearish signal. Like all strategies within the Ichimoku system, the tenkan sen/kijun sen cross needs to be viewed in terms of the bigger Ichimoku picture before making any trading decisions, as this will give the strategy the best chances of success. In general, the tenkan sen/kijun sen strategy can be classified into three (3) major classifications: strong, neutral and weak.  Conducting further technical review, shares of Athabasca Oil Corp (ATHOF) have a 200-day moving average of 1.05. The 50-day is 0.88, and the 7-day is sitting at 0.74. Using a wider time frame to assess the moving average such as the 200-day, may help block out the noise and chaos that is often caused by daily price fluctuations. In some cases, MA’s may be used as strong reference points for spotting support and resistance levels. Employing the use of the moving average for technical equity analysis is still highly popular among traders and investors. The moving average can be used as a reference point to assist with the discovery of buying and selling opportunities.  Investors have the ability to approach the stock market from various angles. This may include using technical analysis, fundamental analysis, or a combination or the two. Investors watching the technical levels may be trying to chart patterns and discover trends in stock price movement. Investors tracking the fundamentals may be looking closely at many different factors. They may be focused on industry performance, earnings estimates, dividend payouts, and other factors. They might also be studying how the company is run, and trying to figure out the true value of the firm. Keeping track of all the data may seem overwhelming, but it may help give a needed boost to the portfolio.  Athabasca Oil Corp (ATHOF)’s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R currently sits at -77.69. The Williams %R oscillates in a range from 0 to -100. A reading between 0 and -20 would point to an overbought situation. A reading from -80 to -100 would signal an oversold situation. The Williams %R was developed by Larry Williams. This is a momentum indicator that is the inverse of the Fast Stochastic Oscillator.  Athabasca Oil Corp (ATHOF) currently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -68.89. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal.  Currently, the 14-day ADX for Athabasca Oil Corp (ATHOF) is sitting at 25.44. Generally speaking, an ADX value from 0-25 would indicate an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would support a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would identify a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would lead to an extremely strong trend. ADX is used to gauge trend strength but not trend direction. Traders often add the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to identify the direction of a trend.  The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a widely used technical momentum indicator that compares price movement over time. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold. The RSI may be useful for spotting abnormal price activity and volatility. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. The normal reading of a stock will fall in the range of 30 to 70. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued. A reading under 30 may indicate that the stock is oversold, and possibly undervalued. After a recent check, the 14-day RSI is currently at 39.93, the 7-day stands at 41.71, and the 3-day is sitting at 49.68.",287584269,2017-08-21 07:46:24,"Drilling into the Technicals   Valuation For Athabasca Oil Corp  ATHOF  *** Drilling into the Technicals  Valuation For Athabasca Oil Corp ATHOF   Evergreen CallerFull coverage *** Drilling into the Technicals & Valuation For Athabasca Oil Corp (ATHOF)  Aug 21, 2017  Evergreen Staff Contributor  Athabasca Oil Corp (ATHOF)’s moving averages reveal that the Tenkan line of the shares are above the Kijun-Sen line, indicating potential upward momentum building in the bullish chart.  Athabasca Oil Corp moved -0.004 in the most recent session and touched 0.7390 on a recent tick.

It is widely believed that a stock’s future performance can best be predicted by analyzing prior trends and patterns in price. In the case of BHGE, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed in the future.  How has the stock performed recently?  Baker Hughes, a GE company (NYSE:BHGE) has been trading in a bearish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. In the last month, the price of BHGE has decreased -7.26%. Shares are now down -36.89% over the past year, underperforming the broad market by -399.68% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 12%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $32.69, BHGE sits -52.34% below its 52-week high.  Momentum indicators  Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that BHGE may be headed in the future. Fortunately, there is way to use the speed and magnitude of these price changes to predict future performance, thanks to what are known as momentum indicators. As momentum slows, it might be a sign that a support or resistance level has been reached, and that a trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for BHGE is 26.55%, which suggests that the stock may be primed for a trend reversal or a breakout to the upside. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 4.67%, tells a similar story, and suggests that BHGE currently trades in oversold territory.  What do the trading volumes reveal?  Volume patterns are useful for gauging the level of conviction behind price changes, and can be used to make predictions about future price movements. A sudden increase in a stock’s activity can be a sign that investors are trading in anticipation of a catalyst, or that investors feel very strongly in one way or the other about the future direction of a stock. Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE) average trading volume of 2,683,100 during the past month is 8.3% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times.  What do the analysts think?  BHGE is currently undervalued by -35.79% relative to the average 1-year price target of $50.91 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.40, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for BHGE over the next year.  How risky is the stock?  In order to put BHGE’s recent price performance into context, we need to get a sense of how the stock moves in relation to the overall market. Beta, which measures a stock’s price volatility relative to the market, provides the cleanest measure of systematic risk for a stock.  Baker Hughes, a GE company (NYSE:BHGE) has a beta of 0.88, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are less extreme than the market as a whole. BHGE therefore has a below average level of market risk.

Devin Koller  August 19, 2017  Growth expectations for Baker Hughes a GE company (NYSE:BHGE) are high, but many investors are starting to ask whether its last close at $32.8 can still be rationalized by the future potential. There are some general checks that I have up my sleeve when I have uncertainties over the value a company is providing. Let’s take a look at how BHGE stacks up against these. See our latest analysis for BHGE  What can we expect from BHGE in the future?  Baker Hughes a GE’s extremely high growth potential is attracting investors. Depending on who you listen to, expectations are extremely bullish with analysts estimating the EPS to go from $0.83 to $2.95 over the next 3-5 years. This is roughly a growth rate range of -52% to 322%. During the same time revenue is predicted to jump from $12.66 Billion to $28.31 Billion in 2020 and profit is predicted to catapult from $353 Million to $2.39 Billion in 2020, roughly growing 6.8x. Margins are expected to be muted at a single digit rate of 8.45%.  What is Baker Hughes a GE’s value based on current earnings?  As Warren Buffett’s right-hand man Charlie Munger said, “No matter how wonderful a business is, it’s not worth an infinite price.” Baker Hughes a GE is available at price to earnings ratio of 39.5x, showing us it is overvalued when compared to the US market average of 23.6x and overvalued based on current earnings compared to the Energy industry average of 31.3x .  NYSE:BHGE PE PEG Gauge Aug 19th 17  P/E ratio is simply a stock’s price divided by its earnings per share (EPS). It is a straightforward and popular way of assessing how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar a company earns.  Can BHGE’s share price be justified by its earnings growth?  We already know that BHGE appears to be overvalued when compared to its industry average.But since Baker Hughes a GE is a high growth stock, we must also account for its earnings growth by using calculation called PEG ratio.  The PEG ratio (price/earnings to growth ratio) is a valuation metric used to assess the relative trade-off between the price of a stock, the earnings per share (EPS), and the company’s expected growth. Since P/E ratio is in general higher for a company with a higher growth rate, using just the P/E ratio would make high-growth companies appear overvalued relative to others. By dividing the P/E ratio by the earnings growth rate, the resulting ratio is considered to provide a more complete picture when comparing companies with different growth rates.  Expected 26.4% growth in earnings next year and P/E ratio of 39.5x give Baker Hughes a GE a higher PEG ratio of 1.5x. Based on that Baker Hughes a GE’s stock can be considered as slightly overvalued based on its fundamentals.  What next?

There are some general checks that I have up my sleeve when I have uncertainties over the value a company is providing. Let’s take a look at how BHGE stacks up against these. See our latest analysis for BHGE  What can we expect from BHGE in the future?  Baker Hughes a GE’s extremely high growth potential is attracting investors. Depending on who you listen to, expectations are extremely bullish with analysts estimating the EPS to go from $0.83 to $2.95 over the next 3-5 years. This is roughly a growth rate range of -52% to 322%. During the same time revenue is predicted to jump from $12.66 Billion to $28.31 Billion in 2020 and profit is predicted to catapult from $353 Million to $2.39 Billion in 2020, roughly growing 6.8x. Margins are expected to be muted at a single digit rate of 8.45%.  What is Baker Hughes a GE’s value based on current earnings?  As Warren Buffett’s right-hand man Charlie Munger said, “No matter how wonderful a business is, it’s not worth an infinite price.” Baker Hughes a GE is available at price to earnings ratio of 39.5x, showing us it is overvalued when compared to the US market average of 23.6x and overvalued based on current earnings compared to the Energy industry average of 31.3x .  NYSE:BHGE PE PEG Gauge Aug 19th 17  P/E ratio is simply a stock’s price divided by its earnings per share (EPS). It is a straightforward and popular way of assessing how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar a company earns.  Can BHGE’s share price be justified by its earnings growth?  We already know that BHGE appears to be overvalued when compared to its industry average.But since Baker Hughes a GE is a high growth stock, we must also account for its earnings growth by using calculation called PEG ratio.  The PEG ratio (price/earnings to growth ratio) is a valuation metric used to assess the relative trade-off between the price of a stock, the earnings per share (EPS), and the company’s expected growth. Since P/E ratio is in general higher for a company with a higher growth rate, using just the P/E ratio would make high-growth companies appear overvalued relative to others. By dividing the P/E ratio by the earnings growth rate, the resulting ratio is considered to provide a more complete picture when comparing companies with different growth rates.  Expected 26.4% growth in earnings next year and P/E ratio of 39.5x give Baker Hughes a GE a higher PEG ratio of 1.5x. Based on that Baker Hughes a GE’s stock can be considered as slightly overvalued based on its fundamentals.  What next?

The firm’s price-to-sales ratio was noted 0.34 in contrast with an overall industry average of 1.36. Most of the active traders and investors are keen to find ways to compare the value of stocks. The price-to-sales ratio offers a simple approach in this case. They just need to take the company’s market capitalization and divide it by the company’s total sales over the past 12 months. The lesser the ratio, the more attractive the investment. During the key period of last 5 years, Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) sales have annually surged -9.70% on average, however its earnings per share growth remained at 6.00%.  How Company Returns Shareholder’s Value?  Dividends is a reward scheme, that a company presents to its shareholders. There can be various forms of dividends, such as cash payment, stocks or any other form. This payment is usually a part of the profit of the company. A company’s dividend is mostly determined by its board of directors and it requires the shareholders’ approval. Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) for the trailing twelve months paying dividend with the payout ratio of 64.22% to its shareholders. Currently it is offering a dividend yield of 4.32% and a 5 year dividend growth rate of 51.57%. Over the last year Company’s shares have been trading in the range of $51.17 and $71.40. However yesterday the stock remained in between $64.45 and $64.95. The stock is above its 52-week low with 26.44% and is in the wake of its 52-week high with -9.38%.  Performance & Technicalities  In the latest week Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) stock volatility was recorded 1.64% which for the previous full month was noted 1.57%. Meanwhile the stock weekly performance was subdued at -3.13%, which was down for the month at -4.54%. Likewise, the upbeat performance for the last quarter was 1.35% and for the full year it was 18.02%. Moreover the Company’s Year To Date performance was -5.30%. Now a days one of the fundamental indicator used in the technical analysis is called Stochastic %D”, Stochastic indicator was created by George Lane. The stochastic is a momentum indicator comparing the closing price of a security to the range of its prices over a fix period of time. The gauge is based on the assumption that if price surges, the closing price tends towards the values that belong to the upper part of the area of price movements in the preceding period. On the other hand if price drops, the contrary is right. For Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), Stochastic %D value stayed at 11.83% for the last 9 days. Considering more the value stands at 8.93% and 8.82% for 14 and 20 days, in that order.  Baker Hughes, a GE company (NYSE:BHGE) closed at $32.54 a share in the latest session and the stock value rose almost -28.10% since the beginning of this year. The company has managed to keep price to sales ratio of 3.98 against an industry average of 3.50. The price to sales ratio is the ratio of the market value of equity to the sales. This ratio is internally not steady, since the market value of equity is divided by the total revenues of the firm. Its revenue stood at -13.10% a year on average in the period of last five years. Firm’s net income measured an average growth rate of -29.10%. Following last close company’s stock, is -11.20% below their SMA 50 and -31.90% below the 52-week high. A simple moving average (SMA) is an mathematical moving average calculated by adding the closing price of the security for a number of time periods and then dividing this total by the number of time periods. Its most recent closing price has a distance of -6.88% from SMA20 and is -20.28% below than SMA200.  In-Depth Technical Study  Investors generally keep an extensive variety of technical indicators at their disposal for completing technical stock analysis. The average true range is a moving average, generally 14 days, of the true ranges.  The average true range (ATR) was fashioned to allow traders to more precisely evaluate the daily volatility of an asset by using straightforward calculations. However the indicator does not specify the price direction, rather it is used first and foremost to measure volatility caused by gaps and limit up or down moves. The ATR is fairly simple to calculate and only needs historical price data.  ATR is counted for different periods, like 9-day, 14-day, 20-day, 50-day and 100-day. At the moment, the 14-day ATR for Baker Hughes, a GE company (NYSE:BHGE) is noted at 1.02.

Executives, geologists, operators, investors and developers were schooled on the subject at the Oil and Gas Authority’s Technology Forum in Aberdeen.  The booked out event drew more than 180 people, who were told that technology was “critical” to unlocking every last drop of oil held in the UK continental shelf (UKCS).  It comes ahead of the November deadline for the 30th licensing round, focussed on mature areas of the UKCS – some of which were last offered for licensing more than 40 years ago.  The November deadline is expected to bring about the most significant offshore round in recent decades.  And Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) operations director Gunther Newcombe said adapting technology to fit the remaining North Sea resources would be seen as a major factor in who is awarded what acreage.  He set the scene to the plenary session, when he said: “Do we have a lot of potential remaining in the UKCS still remaining? Absolutely yes.  “Another good backdrop to this is that production is up, hopefully 1.7million barrels of oil equivalent per day by the end of this year and also production efficiency is up to 73%.  “We’ve got 14 or so new developments coming on stream this year so it’s quite a vibrant UKCS here that we have in the 30th round.  “There’s still plenty of ‘yet-to’find- potential out there.  “And technology will be one of the key drivers to unlocking that potential.  “One of the things that the OGA wants to do is really drive technology into, not just exploration, but right through development and into production. And we will certainly be looking more and more at companies to engage with technology and apply and adapt technology in the UKCS.”  The 30th round has more than 800 blocks on offer , equating to roughly six times the size of Wales.  In that space there is 140 discoveries on offer with around 2.3billion barrels of resource discovered in those areas.  And Newcombe said the OGA “expects technology” to be included in the applications for the round.  He said: “Part of the marking system for the licensing round will be about what technology you are going to offer, adapt and deploy.  “Seismic technology and imaging of the subsurface are obviously critical to reducing risk. Trying to get that well cost down is also incredible important.  “Geosteering is critically important. We are seen a lot of development in the Southern North Sea in that area in particular.  “And also adapting other technologies in the area of wells.  “So it’s about getting the cost in the right place and seeing your reservoirs and seeing your tracks.”  He added: “You need to tie back these things obviously so if you’ve got infrastructure there efficient tiebacks is important, looking at in a different way.  “For example hot taps to having different types of pipeline like spool pipelines for instance to try  and get some of these tiebacks hooked up.  “Many of the discoveries are in the standalone  environment so we need to look at in a different way rather than having these gold plated structures. Are there smaller things that we could use and adapt for smaller pools? Again, being versatile and being to able to adapt technology to the resource is really important.”  More than 35 exhibitors from SMEs to major service providers including PGS, Baker Hughes, a GE company, Amplus and Western Geco, showcased at the event in Aberdeen yesterday.  Chris Pearson, OGTC Small Pools Solution Centre Manager, added: “This is another first for the OGA and OGTC. We are working collaboratively with an innovative and supportive group of companies to make the license round a success.  “The showcase event highlighted how technology solutions can significantly lower the entire life-cycle cost for UKCS field developments. We can be both incremental and disruptive in our approach to how we deploy the solutions. This approach can make this stable and mature basin an attractive investment opportunity.”  Recommended for you  X  Technology Forum to help unlock future oil and gas developments  Related Articles  OGA unveils new measures for unlocking vital North Sea data  Technology Forum to help unlock future oil and gas developments  OGA accentuates the mature with launch of 30th North Sea bidding round  FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInEmail  Read the latest opinion pieces from our Energy Voice columnists  Opinion: The Total-Maersk deal – great for both sides  Opinion: The importance of employing a talented workforce through apprenticeships  Opinion: OPEC cutbacks are diluted by oil’s long bloat  Opinion: Transocean must lead way in thinning out global fleet post-Songa takeover  Opinion: Preserve to conserve – maximise the value of cold stacking",287584269,2017-08-23 05:05:04,"Oil industry given Darwinism lesson on adapting to survive in North Sea *** Oil industry given Darwinism lesson on adapting to survive in North Sea  Energy VoiceFull coverage *** Oil & Gas  Oil industry given Darwinism lesson on adapting to survive in North Sea  Written by Alan Shields -  23/08/2017 7:10 am  FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInEmail  Gunther Newcombe  Sign up to our daily newsletter  Subscribe TodayPackages from £10 per month  The North Sea oil industry has been given a lesson on Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection.

But by age 8, I’d filled my room with stuffed toy dogs and issues of Dog Fancy magazine from the local library, proclaiming instead that I’d one day become a veterinarian. By 16, I knew I was meant to be a baker, and my library checkout record was short on Dog Fancy and long on recipe books.advertisementKids often grow out of the habit of cycling through passions and dream jobs–that’s the expectation, anyway. But my career interests continued to shift throughout my 20s–not just once but multiple times–jumping from hospitality to real estate to technology. Though some of these paths didn’t last for more than a few seasons, each position gave me a broader perspective on the world and helped move me toward what I really wanted to do. And in my late 20s, I finally ditched urban corporate America altogether to start building my own company overseas.I’ve “started over” more times than I can count, sometimes with negative dollars in the bank, and I don’t regret it. Here’s what I’ve learned, and what I’d recommend for anybody early in their career who’s already thinking about making a dramatic transition.Related: I’m Living Proof That It’s Time To Redefine The “American Dream”Pursue Happiness (Right Now), Not StatusWhile I was switching career paths in New York, many people told me, “Don’t quit your job so soon! No one else will ever hire you.” I often felt like a failure who couldn’t keep her act together. Looking back, though, I feel empowered and happy that I didn’t spend the limited hours I have on this planet doing something that wasn’t right for me.“Prior to my culinary journey, I was a management consultant in the fashion and luxury goods space, and a Columbia MBA,” says professional chef and entrepreneur Jenny Dorsey. “Despite the fact that my life looked great from the outside, I knew I was deeply unfulfilled on the inside. I yearned to create more, especially tangible things that would have real impact on people’s lives,” so Dorsey ditched her status-driven career and went to culinary school instead.Related: Four Career Mistakes You Should Make In Your 20sadvertisement“There is no good time, so do it now,” she adds. “This has held true for me across any difficult transition I’ve made. The coy ability of time to make future decisions seem less formidable is something to be reckoned with, but the truth is it only gets harder, not easier. Take the plunge now, and don’t look back.”You Know More Than You Think–So Market The Hell Out Of ItWhile it’s important to show commitment, sometimes your goals and perspectives change, especially when you’re just getting your feet wet in the workforce. For each new job change I made, I recast any experience from my previous role into relevant, transferrable skills in a new industry. This takes effort, but it may not be as hard as you think. Write a resume for the person you want to be, using your existing skills and successes.And if hiring managers aren’t buying it, sell those skills directly in the job market. “I was working in PR and event planning and got tired of the hectic lifestyle and working for someone else,” says Camille Holden, founder of Nuts & Bolts Speed Training. “My boyfriend and I decided to break free and start our own business. It was a super-simple idea, really: to sell our existing knowledge and expertise. So we started an online training business that teaches business professionals how to be more efficient with PowerPoint.”In Holden’s experience, the conventional wisdom to “skill up” by taking courses, signing up for bootcamps, and adding new credentials isn’t the only way to succeed. Even for people in their 20s, she says, “If you’re looking to start a business, don’t worry about inventing something new, but instead go with something you’re already great at. You may have to dig a bit, but there’s no use starting from complete ground zero.”Related: How My Entry-Level Job Helped Me Become A Mid-20s EntrepreneurLean On Your Support SystemThough I’ve had my share of naysayers about my career decisions, I’ve been fortunate to have a support system that more often says, “You should do it!” than “You’re crazy!” I’ve found that when you’re looking to make a career jump, it’s important to keep negative Nancys at a distance. Surround yourself with people who share your passion and believe in your goals–whatever they might consist of right now.advertisementThat’s especially true early on, when you might not have the most certainty about your abilities and feel that you still have to prove yourself. But over time, the network of cheerleaders who support your efforts will give you the confidence to take bigger leaps.“I just turned 44 this year,” says Veronica Sopher, a newly minted developer who was previously a marketing communications expert at Microsoft. Going full-time into a tech role, she says, “took a lot of hand wringing, discussions with my family, and advice from close friends. Even though I knew I needed to make the change, it still felt ‘irresponsible’ to abandon a perfectly good career path and reduce our household income for my own pursuit.” But because Sopher had made significant shifts earlier on in her career, she’s learned which voices to listen to and which ones to tune out.Related: How To Turn Your Close Friends Into Career Mentors“The lesson is, not everybody deserves to hear about my dreams and ambitions.” Sopher has a point. It’s usually in your 20s that you learn some of your friends may be fun to hang out with on a Saturday night, but aren’t the best peer mentors when it comes to career stuff. So join a group and learn alongside others. Maybe it’s a career-change bootcamp you pay for, and maybe it’s just a Facebook group for like-minded people looking for advice and support.Whatever type of network you tap to help you make your move, keep in mind that you’re not the only one to do this.Don’t Cut Ties After GraduatingWhen I decided to start my own business, I jumped headfirst into the startup scene, making connections that helped me build my business to where it is today. Networking often feels like a chore, and when you’re new to the job market and have a bland, low-level job title, it can feel especially depressing. But pulling off significant job changes in your 20s requires some type of network, even if it isn’t the sort you build by hitting up dozens of traditional networking events.advertisementIndeed, one of the easiest ways to turn what might feel like a crappy network into a powerful one is to keep in touch with people you went to school with. When Chris Georgiev, founder of the image-recognition platform Imagga, left the corporate world to dive into entrepreneurship, he contacted former classmates. Reconnect with some of your best university friends to see who might be a great fit for collaboration. He eventually found a cofounder with a similar dream. “I’m glad I didn’t jump into this new adventure alone.”There’s always more money to be made–and made back if an investment doesn’t pan out–but it’s impossible to get more time. If you’re not happy today, you don’t have to be permanently stuck. Nor do you have to wait until a certain age when it suddenly “makes sense” for you to switch careers. Each day is an opportunity to try something new, explore your creativity, and build a career that you’re proud of.

Held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, hosted by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), and organised by the Global Energy division of dmg events, ADIPEC has a successful history of attracting the industry’s top CEOs as speakers.The separate Global Business Leader panels were launched in 2015 with two sessions. The positive response saw a third session added in 2016, and organisers will include a fourth panel discussion for 2017. With this year seeing ADIPEC expand to include downstream industries for the first time, an additional programme will include three Downstream Global Business Leader panels.“ADIPEC is unique for its ability to attract such a broad group of industry seniors to an annual event, driven by the market power of the region’s NOCs and their IOC partners,” said Ali Khalifa Al Shamsi, CEO, Al Yasat Petroleum Operations Co. Ltd and ADIPEC 2017 Chairman. “Nowhere else will industry professionals get such an insight into the strategic thinking guiding the industry forward, from individuals whose decisions are critical to the future of oil and gas businesses.”With planning for ADIPEC entering its final weeks, organisers have confirmed the involvement of 13 CEOs for the Global Business Leader panels and are in talks with many more across the global industry. A further nine CEOs have been confirmed for the Downstream Global Business Leader programme. Beyond the conference programme, CEOs convene at ADIPEC to do business and sign deals, offering conference delegates an opportunity not only to learn from the best, but also to grow their business and find new opportunities.The confirmed CEO speakers include Bob Dudley, Group Chief Executive at UK-headquartered multinational, BP; Datuk Zulkiflee W. Ariffin, President and Group CEO of Malaysian national oil company, Petroliam Nasional Berhad (Petronas); Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO of France’s Total; Vagit Alekperov, President, Member of the Board of Directors, and Chairman of the Management Committee, at Russia’s Lukoil; Musabbeh Al Kaabi, CEO, Petroleum and Petrochemicals, Mubadala Investment Company; Mario Mehren, Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors, Wintershall; Toshiaki Kitamura, President and CEO at Japan’s INPEX Corporation; and Claudio Descalzi, CEO at Italian multinational, Eni.Their individual perspectives include experience at some of the world’s largest vertically integrated oil and gas companies, including two of the industry ‘supermajors’, operating across a diverse range of international markets, both in terms of exploration and production, and in terms of sales. They will be joined by the heads of three of the biggest international suppliers of oilfield services: David Dickson, President and Chief Executive Officer at McDermott; Mark McCollum, CEO at Weatherford, and Lorenzo Simonelli, President and CEO at Baker Hughes, a GE company.Offering a regional perspective on oil and gas investment will be Mansour Al Mulla, Chief Financial Officer, Petroleum and Petrochemicals, Mubadala Investment Company, while Brian Gilvary, Group Chief Financial Officer at BP, will offer an international view.“ADIPEC is the leading event for the global oil and gas industry, and that is reflected in the status of speakers we consistently attract for our conference programme,” said Christopher Hudson, President – Global Energy at dmg events. “The executives who have agreed to be part of our Global Business Leader panels are among those whose decisions shape the future of the industry, and who are most qualified to discuss the path forward for oil and gas in the coming years.”With ADIPEC 2017 to be held under the theme ‘Forging Ties, Driving Growth’, the four Global Business Leader panels will focus on strategies that can deliver continuing business success, with discussion of the most pressing topics facing the sector today. There will also be a highly focused session on energy finance, investment, consolidation and diversification.“The oil and gas industry continues to be a key driver for the global economy, but the market is changing, and industry leaders must respond,” said Hudson. “ADIPEC is a platform where businesses can share ideas that will help them evolve with the commercial environment. With our invited CEO speakers for 2017, we are placing greater emphasis on leaders with a truly global footprint. Their decisions will define the future for oil and gas: pioneering new ideas and breaking boundaries, fostering relationships, and building on momentum.”More than 10 000 delegates, 2200 exhibiting companies, 900 speakers, and in excess of 100 000 visitors, from 135 countries, are projected to gather in Abu Dhabi for ADIPEC 2017.In its 20th edition, ADIPEC is firmly established as the world’s most influential oil and gas industry event, and the ADIPEC Conference Programme sets the standard for the exchange of best practice and operational excellence. Dedicated 2017 conference sessions include offshore and marine, women in energy and security in energy, along with global downstream technical sessions. The downstream sessions are new for this year, emphasising downstream expansion, diversification, integration, and technology innovation and R&D.Other features include the ADIPEC Awards, which celebrate excellence in energy; Young ADIPEC, designed to encourage students to choose a career in energy; and the exclusive VIP programme briefings for members of the Middle East Petroleum Club.ADIPEC will be held at Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre from 13 to 16 November 2017.

Technology and its potential to disrupt and impact investments is making its way up the agenda for institutional investors.Sources said both the risks and opportunities afforded by technological advances are firmly in their sights, with some examining the impact across their portfolios.Stanford University researcher Ashby Monk said he has heard a lot on the topic lately, with three angles to it. The first has institutional investors focusing on whether technology is going to blow up the portfolio of assets we currently hold, Mr. Monk said. One example he cited were investments in parking garages in a world of driverless cars. That is a big focus. If youre in a public equities team (at a pension fund or within any active management process), its probably an area youre interested in unraveling as kind of a threat to the core assets in your portfolio.  Related Coverage  Investors start to prep for market disruptions  Investors see innovation as way out of limbo  AI key for third wave of hedge fund managers  AI? Its not sci-fi anymore  Machine learning will transform investment management  AI going to head of the class  A lot of organizations (such as sovereign wealth funds and pension funds) are arriving in Silicon Valley, not (looking) for the next great startup, but to try to get a sense of the risk, he said. Mr. Monk, who is the executive director of Stanfords Global Projects Center, Palo Alto, Calif., said the second angle involves investors considering how to take this disruption and participate in it, to allow (investors) to get some of this new value. He said bad experiences in the past with venture capital — a traditional way of accessing disruptive investments — mean institutional investors are really scratching their heads and thinking, how do we do this? Options include seeding new managers or​ direct investment, he said. Nobody has really cracked it yet in terms of identifying the next great model. The third element is institutional investors own investment processes, and considering how technology might enable them to remove the cost of an external manager.All three have increased in their relevance in just the last six months, Mr. Monk added.The issue of technologys potential to disrupt portfolios is under consideration by a number of pension fund executives.Were looking at it from a risk point of view — weve done work in the climate area, seeking better disclosure on climate risk, but well be looking very closely at how companies we are seeking to invest in are dealing with (disruption risks), said Hugh OReilly, president and CEO at OPTrust, which manages the C$19 billion ($15 billion) Ontario Public Service Employees Union Pension Plan, Toronto. Plan executives want to know whether these companies are conscious of the risks and preparing for them, and want to see the innovative culture within companies. We have to be thinking about where we are, where were going, and be thoughtful and responsible around it, Mr. OReilly said.  Internal needs  Disruptive technology also filters through to the way pension fund executives manage the plan itself. We view the world were in now — the innovation economy — as a challenge, Mr. OReilly said. Sure, its a risk and we have to understand it. If you look at how technology has disrupted (to date), its fundamentally about disrupting the way in which information is managed.​ He said a pension fund is, at its core, an information manager. We see that, over time, the way we serve our members in terms of how we communicate … is affected by new technology.Disruption in information management also relates to the investment process. Mr. OReilly cited the rise of passive management, which is going to find its way through all of the investment process, whether private equity, infrastructure, real estate. Automation is going to play a role as it can free up time. Its going to become more and more part of our reality, and means for us, our strategic plan is founded upon innovation. We want to view innovation as more of a mindset. Will we be comfortable failing, failing fast and getting better because of that? Are we going to be able to use technology … to figure out ways to better serve our members?Financial technology firms are finding themselves increasingly in demand for partnerships and work, said sources at these types of firms. Trends toward increased alternative investment and insourcing have served SimCorp, a provider of integrated investment management systems, well.Were now getting to the level where some of our clients have 20%, maybe 30% in alternative investments, said Marc Schroter, Copenhagen-based senior vice president, product management at SimCorp. As they do that, their need for technology support increases. Mr. Schroter said investors might have used spreadsheets in the past or best of breed applications, but if you have 25% of total assets in such an asset class, you want to consolidate with the rest of the asset classes and have a total overview of risk and the ability to perform analysis functions. The firm in June announced work with the 250 billion Danish kroner ($39.6 billion) PKA, Hellerup, Denmark, to develop a private debt module in SimCorps Dimension platform. PKA has been a SimCorp client since 2005. Inger Huus Pedersen, Copenhagen-based head of fixed income at PKA, said it was a very useful facility as we do invest more and more in private debt.The increased move toward insourcing of money management is also increasing the need for technology system support, added Mr. Schroter. As they move into doing a lot of the investments themselves, their requirements are more advanced than for asset managers because they have this link to their liabilities.These investors want to understand the impact of a trading scenario or allocation change on risk and accounting figures, among other considerations.Mr. Schroter said regulation is also impacting institutional investors. Something we see a lot of clients asking for is driven by solvency (requirements) — investment forecasting, the idea that you would not make a big change in your portfolio without understanding exactly what are the impacts. Fintech firm ClearMacro Ltd. is working to automate as much as is sensible, bringing man and machine together with its asset allocation, portfolio analytics and integrated research services, said Mike Simcock, London-based CEO and CIO at the firm. The process allows a chief investment officer or investment team to adjust the platforms algorithms to interpret masses of data, and users can also map ClearMacros insights gained from data over their own portfolios to evaluate areas of risk and opportunity, according to different time horizons. Mr. Simcock said the platform is in the early stages of marketing, with existing clients including a sovereign wealth fund. About 35 other investors are​ in various stages of conversation.Investment opportunities  Advancing technology also is opening up new areas of investment opportunity for institutions and active money managers.OPTrusts Mr. OReilly said executives are in the process of establishing an incubation portfolio, accounting for 1.5% of assets — about C$300 million. Relatively small investments of around C$20 million to C$40 million will be made into new areas where we have not historically invested, and we can learn about the new area to determine if (it) is scalable and how we best participate, be it directly or through funds. This is one thing we want to explore. We are fiduciaries; we only invest where we think we will earn a return. One area of investing is emerging growth, a late-stage venture where a company has gotten off the ground, has a product, has consumers but needs capital to grow. Were going to get active in this.Mr. OReilly said this is historically a difficult area because a small capital investment requires a huge staff commitment. Were trying to work out how best to do it. We also think, by investing in this part of the economy we get insights into new technology coming and how it will affect our portfolio overall.

The ability to separate out the more valuable liquids becomes somewhat apparent in the analysis above. Commodity price changes in the natural gas liquids section may have also helped. Despite the sale of liquids enhanced gas producing properties, the revenue for natural gas liquids increased noticeably. In fact, that increase cancelled the declining oil and condensate revenue decline. Notice that the company shows a comfortable revenue gain without much of a volume change for liquids.  The sales of properties also caused a mix change. The company has also hi-graded its drilling prospects for more liquids. Management has clearly moved towards a more favorable sales mix with every tool at its disposal. That movement has resulted in a slightly more favorable operating margin shown below.  Source: Bellatrix Exploration Management Discussion and Analysis, Second Quarter 2017 In line with the sales mix change (click on Q2 report), transportation expenses took a big jump. Part of that jump is due to the delay in the Alder Flats Processing Plant expansion. More of it is probably due to the sales mix change and the sales of some processing plant interests when the company needed cash. It looks like at least some products are shipped by truck (or a similarly expensive way). In any event, the initial progress is positive for the margin. Management clearly has time due to the margin expansion to determine a more cost effective way of doing things. This is one of very few companies to show a second-quarter comparison margin expansion. So any expansion at all is noteworthy. On the gas side, which is much of the production, a very tight fisted approach to costs allowed much of the selling price increase to arrive at the bottom line. This is going to be a very different Bellatrix Exploration going forward.  Source: Bellatrix Exploration Management Discussion and Analysis, Second Quarter 2017 The big news is the funds flow from operations (click on second quarter report). While much of the industry is bemoaning weak commodity pricing, the new management is demonstrating some very positive differences. This company is making some very solid progress towards adequate cash flow. The funds flow is double the figure of the year before despite much of the production increase being gas. Management will not have to pay down working capital every quarter. So that funds flow from operations will assert itself over the long term. The increasing natural gas liquids selling price clearly had an outsized effect here. The company has been very focused on keeping debt low. Non-core properties have been identified and sold to maintain the capital budget. The increasing funds flow from operations demonstrates that not many more sales may be needed to achieve adequate cash flow.

Otherwise, the company shows a gigantic improvement over the previous second quarter. The loss provisions increased, yet, as shown above, cash flow increased. The combination of events can be a sign of a more conservative accounting going forward. It will take probably a year or so of solid progress to be sure. Conservative accounting is not only determined by the type of accounting used but also the assumptions (well life, asset life, and a lot more). When to report a gain or loss can also be done conservatively or aggressively in some instances. So reporting could change before the market even realizes what happened. More conservative reporting is a definite plus for shareholders in the future.

That attitude is beginning to show on the financial statements through lower costs, increased cash flow, and profits before non-operating items.  Source: Bellatrix Exploration August 2017, Corporate Presentation The debt situation has remarkably (click on latest presentation) stabilized. In fact, management sold some properties and the banks did not reduce the credit line. That is a big change in attitude from when the banks could not reduce the credit line fast enough. So management was selling properties and interests in assets to raise cash to decrease the bank debt. Hopefully, management has now learned about the bank debt risks to do things differently in the future. The company is emphasizing the Spirit River section of the leases, but there is clearly a lot more to explore and develop in the future. Management could be very busy for a long time growing profitably with these leases. In fact, competitors may have noticed the improvement of the company and the stock could become a takeover target. Cash flow may not be quite where it should be yet, but a lot of the major problems are resolved. Acquisitions usually favor companies that the market does not like but where most of the problems are gone.  Source: Bellatrix Exploration August 2017, Corporate Presentation Production is already up significantly from the fourth quarter. Despite the historically weak second-quarter results, management is changing guidance for the better. That change pattern should continue throughout the year. Compare this company to Chesapeake Energy (CHK), another gas producer. Bellatrix has grown its production about 15% in six months. Chesapeake, a much larger company, is about to show some slow growth for the first time in years. Chesapeake has a lower lease operating expense than this company, but the higher transportation and interest expense per BOE give Chesapeake a sizable cost disadvantage. Plus Chesapeake has very little cash flow per share for the first six months and that cash flow has yet to grow despite management predictions. Chesapeake reports profits that have no cash flow to back up the profits. Previously booked one-time costs still eliminate much of the cash flow each quarter. That prospect is supposed to change in the near future, but that near future has yet to happen. Bellatrix, on the other hand, is increasing its cash flow. Except for an impairment charge and the tax liability, Bellatrix would have operated near breakeven. Cash flow is more important than profits and Bellatrix has that cash flow on a relative scale. In fact, Bellatrixs shares trade fairly cheaply compared to the latest cash flow figure. Some of that is due to the outstanding debt. The cash flow is not quite good enough to properly service the debt, but the improvement is significant enough to ascertain that the cash flow could soon service the long-term debt. Bellatrix shares could then be revalued by the market. If management keeps going on the current path, Bellatrix common could become a growth story even in the current low commodity price environment. The stock price could easily double over the next 24 months as more profit progress is made.

However, more production history is required to be confident that EURs can increase to become economically competitive.A cyclical decline in AECO prices in 2018 can be a headwind for the stock, as the balance sheet remains weak.The Canadian natural gas junior Bellatrix Exploration (NYSE:BXE) has made significant progress reducing debt, after the company faced critical balance sheet challenges early last year when commodity prices collapsed. However, despite the improved credit and liquidity metrics and stronger commodity prices, the stock has continued to slide lower, losing over 40% of its value in the last six months alone. The decline was not cured by the company’s latest quarterly update, which, in our opinion, contained several positive data points. Bellatrix’s stock performance stands in visible contrast to that of leading dry gas producers in the Marcellus - such as Rice Energy (RICE), EQT Corp. (EQT), and Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) - whose stocks have held ground much better during the same period.  The biggest cause of Bellatrix’s underperformance to date, in our view, is the companys relatively high cost of supply. As the market appears to be increasingly concerned about macro headwinds in 2018, the companys perceived vulnerability, exacerbated by high leverage, is understandable. We note, however, that Bellatrix recently posted impressive well results that give hope that average EURs and economic returns will improve going forward. That said, the bar for competitive well performance is set quite high. Cost Of Supply Needs To Improve To understand Bellatrix’s position on the cost-of-supply curve, we will review the company’s metrics for the second quarter of 2017 reported last week.  The second quarter was relatively favorable in terms of natural gas macro environment for Canadian producers. Looking at the futures curve for Henry Hub, the average price in Q2 of US$3.18 (the table below) was materially higher than the prices anticipated by the futures market for Q2 periods in the next several years.  (Source: Bellatrix Exploration, Q2 2017 MD&A discussion) Price realizations at AECO, the key benchmark for Bellatrix, were also favorable. AECO daily index price improved by C$0.09 from the first quarter, despite a US$0.14 decline in the average NYMEX price. Relative to the current AECO futures curve, Q2’17 averages shown in the table above look quite favorable.  (Source: GasAlberta) How did the company fare financially during a quarter that was favorable from a macro perspective? Please note that all financial data presented below are in Canadian dollars. In Q2, Bellatrix realized operating pre-hedge netback of $9.35 per Boe.  (Source: Bellatrix Exploration, Q2 2017 MD&A discussion) The operating netback metric does not capture certain corporate-level items, such as G&A and interest charges. On the G&A side, in second quarter the company incurred G&A and stock compensation expenses of $7.4 million, or ~$2.14 per Boe, slightly higher than in Q117.  (Source: Bellatrix Exploration, Q2 2017 MD&A discussion) We view G&A and stock compensation expenses as an inevitable cost of doing business. Even if we were to assume that only two-thirds of the second quarter G&A and stock-based compensation costs should be allocated to production, the deduct from the operating margin is still significant, ~$1.42 per Boe. Using this adjusted deduct, the company’s pre-hedge operating netback after G&A and stock-based compensation in Q2 would be $7.93 per Boe. We note that this result is a significant improvement relative to the first quarter, when the same metric was $6.96 per Boe. The improvement is driven by better price realizations, higher production volumes and lower production costs, in part offset by higher transportation costs. Some of the improvement in production costs may reflect the effect of the seasonal spring break in Canada when activity drops sharply. It remains to be seen if Bellatrix will be able to sustain its operating cost reduction during the more active quarters. How does the netback metric compare to the company’s cost of bringing new production online? In its presentation, Bellatrix indicates that its cost to drill, complete and tie-in a new well has been in the $4.0 million range.  (Source: Bellatrix Exploration, August 2017 Investor Presentation) On a going-forward basis, we assume a 10% step-up in drill & complete cost to account for the industry-wide re-inflation trend and assume that ongoing spending on facilities, gathering and other field infrastructure will represent 8% of the total budget (please consider the slide below for reference). Under these assumptions, spending in the coming years would average ~$4.8 million per development-ready well. (By using these assumptions, we give credit to the investments in infrastructure that the company has made to date and assume that the installed production and processing capacity will be sufficient to handle production growth for some time.)  (Source: Bellatrix Exploration Ltd, July 2017 Investor Presentation) If we use the company’s EUR metric of 6.0 Bcfe per well, the cost of bringing development-ready inventory on production would be ~$4.78/Boe. Seemingly, the cash margin per Boe produced significantly exceeds the development cost per Boe. However, it is important to take into account the time value of money and discount future cash flows back to the same point in time when the well is drilled. We apply a 1.6x average discounting factor to the netback of $7.93 per Boe, which, base on our model, corresponds to discounting of roughly 10%. Based on this discounting factor, the present value of future netbacks is ~$4.96 per Boe, which is just enough to cover the $4.78 capital cost of bringing a new Boe online. In other words, even in a relatively favorable macro environment similar to the one we saw in the second quarter, Bellatrix will generate an unlevered return on invested capital of just ~10% at the corporate level unless it manages to consistently deliver wells above its indicated EUR of 6.0 Bcfe or substantially reduces cost per well and operating costs relative to our assumption. (Please note the calculation excludes sunk costs related to land and exploration.) Bellatrix’s transportation costs are expected to decrease materially in the second quarter of 2018, potentially increasing the netback by as much as $1/Boe. On the other hand, the netback is vulnerable to a decline in AECO price in 2018 relative to the average Q2 2017 prices, as indicated by the futures curve. We should also note that the operating netback reflects a blended operating cost for new wells (which is low) and wells that have been on production for some time (which increases over time). Given that Bellatrixs Spirit River is a relatively young asset, production costs per Boe are likely to begin increasing when production growth slows down and older wells become a much larger percentage of the well population. Some allowance for this trend should be built into the return expectation.  In conclusion, even though Bellatrix is no longer facing the same acute liquidity challenges it faced a year ago, the company’s ability to create value through via drillbit, assuming strip price scenario, is still debatable and is dependent on the companys ability to move the average EUR per well materially above 6 Bcfe. Maintenance Capital Another way of looking at Bellatrix’s value creation via drill bit is to review the company’s maintenance capital requirement. In its presentation, Bellatrix projects that it will need to drill ~14 net Spirit River wells to maintain its production flat for the next several years. Using the overall capital cost per well of $4.8 million, the company’s capital requirement to maintain production flat appears to be roughly $67 million. By comparison, Bellatrix’s EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, was $74.5 million, which reflects above-market hedges. Obviously, maintaining production flat while re-investing the entire EBITDA is not good enough, as the cost of capital would not be covered. Therefore, going forward, to generate adequate return, Bellatrix will need to achieve an EBITDA materially above estimated maintenance capital or drill increasingly prolific wells and outperform its production guidance.  (Source: Bellatrix Exploration, August 2017 Investor Presentation) Is A Turnaround Possible? Some of the most recent operational data points provided by Bellatrix are encouraging. Several wells in the 2017 sample appear to have sustained strong rates for an extended period of time. (I must note, however, the wide variability of well results across the sample.) The slide below is perhaps the most important one in the company’s entire presentation. Well performance is critical to determining whether the company’s operating model is competitive.  While additional production history is obviously required, the strong recent well results are a welcome development. That said, as one can see from the discussion above, the threshold for a value-creating EUR per well is quite high, given the company’s cost structure. If Bellatrix can demonstrate average EURs in the 7+ Bcfe range – which at this point is still a hopeful scenario – its operating model would look more competitive and compelling than it has so far.  (Source: Bellatrix Exploration, August 2017 Investor Presentation) While an improvement in well performance is possible, validating a higher type curve will take some time. We should also note that the rest of the industry is not standing still and is working hard to increase EURs and reduce costs. Economic advantage in this highly competitive sector is a relative concept, with the lowest-cost producers continuously raising the benchmark for performance. A Downcycle Can Be A Challenge In the immediate term, the possibility of lower natural gas prices in 2018 is a concern. Bellatrix is currently relying on significant cash outspending to deliver production growth. While hedges and the recent Strachan asset sale have helped to bridge the budget gap this year, we expect the bank debt balance to creep higher by year-end, potentially leaving Bellatrix with reduced flexibility to fund any budget shortfall next year from the revolver. Bellatrix had $13 million drawn under its credit facility as of June, 2017. However, we expect the drawdown to possibly exceed $40 million by the end of this year, assuming no change in the working capital position from the end of Q2. The credit facility currently has $120 million of borrowing capacity.  Given that the company’s hedge protection is weaker in 2018 as compared to 2017 (the slide below) – both in terms of volumes and price levels – lower AECO prices in 2018 would mean sharply lower cash flows. For reference, Bellatrix generated $19.3 million in fund flow (cash flow before changes in working capital and decommissioning) in Q2 2017. Therefore, without additional asset sales, lower prices in 2018 would likely mean a sharply lower year-on-year budget (which in 2017 is $120 million) and possible production decline throughout 2018.  (Source: Bellatrix Exploration, August 2017 Investor Presentation) Production declines from tight sandstone wells are typically quite steep. As one can see from the production graph below (the orange line), Bellatrix experienced a rapid decline in volumes in 2016, following curtailed spending due to the collapse in natural gas prices.  Valuation Using Bellatrix’s TSE share price of $3.05, enterprise value is ~$0.55 billion (please note that I have included working capital deficit of ~$16 million at the end of Q2 2017). Without assuming natural gas prices at AECO in 2018 above the current futures curve, it is difficult to make a case that the stock is trading at a low multiple of EBITDA. In order to justify the current valuation, one needs to assume that the asset is economically viable through the cycle. If Bellatrix can keep very strong well results rolling in and avoid borrowing on the revolver, the market should be able to attribute meaningful value to the asset, regardless of the position in the cycle.  However, in order to be able to drill better, more cost-efficient wells, Bellatrix needs to drill more wells and, therefore, spend more, as it is indeed doing currently. Should another downcycle in natural gas arrive, aggressive spending could lead to fresh concerns on the credit side. Another set of important value-focused questions relates to the geologic complexity of the Spirit River acreage and the size and predictability of the premium inventory. In Conclusion… Even after the big decline in the share price to date, the BXE stock remains a high-risk proposition. Well performance remains the most critical uncertainty. To simply justify the current valuation level, we have to expect a significant improvement in average EUR per well relative to the company’s previous 5.2 Bcfe type curve. The most recent well results highlighted by Bellatrix indeed appear to suggest that the type curve can be significantly exceeded. However, we would not hurry to extrapolate those still scarce data points onto the entire resource base and would wait to see more production history to draw conclusions about the wells EUR potential. The shape and consistency of production declines will be particularly important. In the event of a demonstrated success in terms of wells results, the stock could move significantly higher. Debt currently represents three quarters of the company’s enterprise value, creating a massive financial lever. The stock is already trading as an “option” and can move with a wide amplitude. However, downside scenarios should not be discounted either, as financial leverage is a double-edged sword, and a combination of possible operational disappointments and cyclical commodity weakness could lead to credit concerns. In early 2017, OIL ANALYTICS highlighted Bellatrix as a short idea to its subscribers, based on our macro views and company-specific concerns. Given the 40%+ stock price decline and encouraging well data points, we no longer view BXE as a compelling short idea. However, we remain concerned about the company’s leverage and the assets relative competitiveness that remains to be proven.  While the possibility of operational improvement certainly exists, bridging the cost-of-supply gap to leading Canadian producers, let alone the leading producers in the Marcellus/Utica region appears to be a monumental task for Bellatrix.

However, more production history is required to be confident that EURs can increase to become economically competitive.A cyclical decline in AECO prices in 2018 can be a headwind for the stock, as the balance sheet remains weak.The Canadian natural gas junior Bellatrix Exploration (NYSE:BXE) has made significant progress reducing debt, after the company faced critical balance sheet challenges early last year when commodity prices collapsed. However, despite the improved credit and liquidity metrics and stronger commodity prices, the stock has continued to slide lower, losing over 40% of its value in the last six months alone. The decline was not cured by the company’s latest quarterly update, which, in our opinion, contained several positive data points. Bellatrix’s stock performance stands in visible contrast to that of leading dry gas producers in the Marcellus - such as Rice Energy (RICE), EQT Corp. (EQT), and Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) - whose stocks have held ground much better during the same period.  The biggest cause of Bellatrix’s underperformance to date, in our view, is the companys relatively high cost of supply. As the market appears to be increasingly concerned about macro headwinds in 2018, the companys perceived vulnerability, exacerbated by high leverage, is understandable. We note, however, that Bellatrix recently posted impressive well results that give hope that average EURs and economic returns will improve going forward. That said, the bar for competitive well performance is set quite high. Cost Of Supply Needs To Improve To understand Bellatrix’s position on the cost-of-supply curve, we will review the company’s metrics for the second quarter of 2017 reported last week.  The second quarter was relatively favorable in terms of natural gas macro environment for Canadian producers. Looking at the futures curve for Henry Hub, the average price in Q2 of US$3.18 (the table below) was materially higher than the prices anticipated by the futures market for Q2 periods in the next several years.  (Source: Bellatrix Exploration, Q2 2017 MD&A discussion) Price realizations at AECO, the key benchmark for Bellatrix, were also favorable. AECO daily index price improved by C$0.09 from the first quarter, despite a US$0.14 decline in the average NYMEX price. Relative to the current AECO futures curve, Q2’17 averages shown in the table above look quite favorable.  (Source: GasAlberta) How did the company fare financially during a quarter that was favorable from a macro perspective? Please note that all financial data presented below are in Canadian dollars. In Q2, Bellatrix realized operating pre-hedge netback of $9.35 per Boe.  (Source: Bellatrix Exploration, Q2 2017 MD&A discussion) The operating netback metric does not capture certain corporate-level items, such as G&A and interest charges. On the G&A side, in second quarter the company incurred G&A and stock compensation expenses of $7.4 million, or ~$2.14 per Boe, slightly higher than in Q117.  (Source: Bellatrix Exploration, Q2 2017 MD&A discussion) We view G&A and stock compensation expenses as an inevitable cost of doing business. Even if we were to assume that only two-thirds of the second quarter G&A and stock-based compensation costs should be allocated to production, the deduct from the operating margin is still significant, ~$1.42 per Boe. Using this adjusted deduct, the company’s pre-hedge operating netback after G&A and stock-based compensation in Q2 would be $7.93 per Boe. We note that this result is a significant improvement relative to the first quarter, when the same metric was $6.96 per Boe. The improvement is driven by better price realizations, higher production volumes and lower production costs, in part offset by higher transportation costs. Some of the improvement in production costs may reflect the effect of the seasonal spring break in Canada when activity drops sharply. It remains to be seen if Bellatrix will be able to sustain its operating cost reduction during the more active quarters. How does the netback metric compare to the company’s cost of bringing new production online? In its presentation, Bellatrix indicates that its cost to drill, complete and tie-in a new well has been in the $4.0 million range.  (Source: Bellatrix Exploration, August 2017 Investor Presentation) On a going-forward basis, we assume a 10% step-up in drill & complete cost to account for the industry-wide re-inflation trend and assume that ongoing spending on facilities, gathering and other field infrastructure will represent 8% of the total budget (please consider the slide below for reference). Under these assumptions, spending in the coming years would average ~$4.8 million per development-ready well. (By using these assumptions, we give credit to the investments in infrastructure that the company has made to date and assume that the installed production and processing capacity will be sufficient to handle production growth for some time.)  (Source: Bellatrix Exploration Ltd, July 2017 Investor Presentation) If we use the company’s EUR metric of 6.0 Bcfe per well, the cost of bringing development-ready inventory on production would be ~$4.78/Boe. Seemingly, the cash margin per Boe produced significantly exceeds the development cost per Boe. However, it is important to take into account the time value of money and discount future cash flows back to the same point in time when the well is drilled. We apply a 1.6x average discounting factor to the netback of $7.93 per Boe, which, base on our model, corresponds to discounting of roughly 10%. Based on this discounting factor, the present value of future netbacks is ~$4.96 per Boe, which is just enough to cover the $4.78 capital cost of bringing a new Boe online. In other words, even in a relatively favorable macro environment similar to the one we saw in the second quarter, Bellatrix will generate an unlevered return on invested capital of just ~10% at the corporate level unless it manages to consistently deliver wells above its indicated EUR of 6.0 Bcfe or substantially reduces cost per well and operating costs relative to our assumption. (Please note the calculation excludes sunk costs related to land and exploration.) Bellatrix’s transportation costs are expected to decrease materially in the second quarter of 2018, potentially increasing the netback by as much as $1/Boe. On the other hand, the netback is vulnerable to a decline in AECO price in 2018 relative to the average Q2 2017 prices, as indicated by the futures curve. We should also note that the operating netback reflects a blended operating cost for new wells (which is low) and wells that have been on production for some time (which increases over time). Given that Bellatrixs Spirit River is a relatively young asset, production costs per Boe are likely to begin increasing when production growth slows down and older wells become a much larger percentage of the well population. Some allowance for this trend should be built into the return expectation.  In conclusion, even though Bellatrix is no longer facing the same acute liquidity challenges it faced a year ago, the company’s ability to create value through via drillbit, assuming strip price scenario, is still debatable and is dependent on the companys ability to move the average EUR per well materially above 6 Bcfe. Maintenance Capital Another way of looking at Bellatrix’s value creation via drill bit is to review the company’s maintenance capital requirement. In its presentation, Bellatrix projects that it will need to drill ~14 net Spirit River wells to maintain its production flat for the next several years. Using the overall capital cost per well of $4.8 million, the company’s capital requirement to maintain production flat appears to be roughly $67 million. By comparison, Bellatrix’s EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, was $74.5 million, which reflects above-market hedges. Obviously, maintaining production flat while re-investing the entire EBITDA is not good enough, as the cost of capital would not be covered. Therefore, going forward, to generate adequate return, Bellatrix will need to achieve an EBITDA materially above estimated maintenance capital or drill increasingly prolific wells and outperform its production guidance.  (Source: Bellatrix Exploration, August 2017 Investor Presentation) Is A Turnaround Possible? Some of the most recent operational data points provided by Bellatrix are encouraging. Several wells in the 2017 sample appear to have sustained strong rates for an extended period of time. (I must note, however, the wide variability of well results across the sample.) The slide below is perhaps the most important one in the company’s entire presentation. Well performance is critical to determining whether the company’s operating model is competitive.  While additional production history is obviously required, the strong recent well results are a welcome development. That said, as one can see from the discussion above, the threshold for a value-creating EUR per well is quite high, given the company’s cost structure. If Bellatrix can demonstrate average EURs in the 7+ Bcfe range – which at this point is still a hopeful scenario – its operating model would look more competitive and compelling than it has so far.  (Source: Bellatrix Exploration, August 2017 Investor Presentation) While an improvement in well performance is possible, validating a higher type curve will take some time. We should also note that the rest of the industry is not standing still and is working hard to increase EURs and reduce costs. Economic advantage in this highly competitive sector is a relative concept, with the lowest-cost producers continuously raising the benchmark for performance. A Downcycle Can Be A Challenge In the immediate term, the possibility of lower natural gas prices in 2018 is a concern. Bellatrix is currently relying on significant cash outspending to deliver production growth. While hedges and the recent Strachan asset sale have helped to bridge the budget gap this year, we expect the bank debt balance to creep higher by year-end, potentially leaving Bellatrix with reduced flexibility to fund any budget shortfall next year from the revolver. Bellatrix had $13 million drawn under its credit facility as of June, 2017. However, we expect the drawdown to possibly exceed $40 million by the end of this year, assuming no change in the working capital position from the end of Q2. The credit facility currently has $120 million of borrowing capacity.  Given that the company’s hedge protection is weaker in 2018 as compared to 2017 (the slide below) – both in terms of volumes and price levels – lower AECO prices in 2018 would mean sharply lower cash flows. For reference, Bellatrix generated $19.3 million in fund flow (cash flow before changes in working capital and decommissioning) in Q2 2017. Therefore, without additional asset sales, lower prices in 2018 would likely mean a sharply lower year-on-year budget (which in 2017 is $120 million) and possible production decline throughout 2018.  (Source: Bellatrix Exploration, August 2017 Investor Presentation) Production declines from tight sandstone wells are typically quite steep. As one can see from the production graph below (the orange line), Bellatrix experienced a rapid decline in volumes in 2016, following curtailed spending due to the collapse in natural gas prices.  Valuation Using Bellatrix’s TSE share price of $3.05, enterprise value is ~$0.55 billion (please note that I have included working capital deficit of ~$16 million at the end of Q2 2017). Without assuming natural gas prices at AECO in 2018 above the current futures curve, it is difficult to make a case that the stock is trading at a low multiple of EBITDA. In order to justify the current valuation, one needs to assume that the asset is economically viable through the cycle. If Bellatrix can keep very strong well results rolling in and avoid borrowing on the revolver, the market should be able to attribute meaningful value to the asset, regardless of the position in the cycle.  However, in order to be able to drill better, more cost-efficient wells, Bellatrix needs to drill more wells and, therefore, spend more, as it is indeed doing currently. Should another downcycle in natural gas arrive, aggressive spending could lead to fresh concerns on the credit side. Another set of important value-focused questions relates to the geologic complexity of the Spirit River acreage and the size and predictability of the premium inventory. In Conclusion… Even after the big decline in the share price to date, the BXE stock remains a high-risk proposition. Well performance remains the most critical uncertainty. To simply justify the current valuation level, we have to expect a significant improvement in average EUR per well relative to the company’s previous 5.2 Bcfe type curve.

Bollinger Bands are a technical analysis tool, specifically they are a type of trading band or envelope. Trading bands and envelopes serve the same purpose, they provide relative definitions of high and low that can be used to create rigorous trading approaches, in pattern recognition, and for much more. Bands are usually thought of as employing a measure of central tendency as a base such as a moving average, whereas envelopes encompass the price structure without a clearly defined central focus, perhaps by reference to highs and lows, or via cyclic analysis. We’ll use the term trading bands to refer to any set of curves that market technicians use to define high or low on a relative basis.  As a market becomes volatile, its Bollinger bands will expand (referred to as expansion); as it flattens out they will contract (contraction). In this way, they enable traders to see beyond short-term volatility and gain insight into longer price movements.  The use of Bollinger bands can also indicate whether a market is heading into overbought or oversold territory. When a market’s price continually moves outside the upper parameters of a Bollinger band, it can be considered to be overbought, and when it moves below the lower band it could be considered oversold.  Technical traders often make a point of keeping an eye on the ATR or Average True Range as well as other key charts. Currently, Bellatrix Exploration Ltd (BXE.TO) has a 14-day ATR of 0.13. The Average True Range is an investor tool used to measure stock volatility. The ATR is not used to figure out price direction, just to measure volatility. The ATR is an indicator developed by J. Welles Wilder. Wilder has developed multiple indicators that are still quite popular in today’s investing landscape. The general interpretation of the ATR is the higher the ATR value, the higher the volatility.  The Williams Percent Range or Williams %R is another technical indicator worth checking out. Bellatrix Exploration Ltd (BXE.TO) currently has a 14 day Williams %R of -98.15. The Williams %R fluctuates between 0 and -100 measuring whether a security is overbought or oversold. The Williams %R is similar to the Stochastic Oscillator except it is plotted upside-down. Levels above -20 may indicate the stock may be considered is overbought. If the indicator travels under -80, this may signal that the stock is oversold. Chart analysts may also use the indicator to project possible price reversals and to define trends.  The Average Directional Index or ADX is technical analysis indicator used to discern if a market is trending or not trending. The ADX alone measures trend strength but not direction. Using the ADX with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) may help determine the direction of the trend as well as the overall momentum. Many traders will use the ADX alongside other indicators in order to help spot proper trading entry/exit points. Currently, the 14-day ADX for Bellatrix Exploration Ltd (BXE.TO) is 17.80. Generally speaking, an ADX value from 0-25 would indicate an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would indicate a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would signal a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would indicate an extremely strong trend.  Traders may be leaning on technical stock analysis to help with investing decisions. Bellatrix Exploration Ltd (BXE.TO) currently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -164.18. Despite the name, CCI can be used on other investment tools such as stocks. The CCI was designed to typically stay within the reading of -100 to +100. Traders may use the indicator to determine stock trends or to identify overbought/oversold conditions. A CCI reading above +100 would imply that the stock is overbought and possibly ready for a correction. On the other hand, a reading of -100 would imply that the stock is oversold and possibly set for a rally.  Traders are paying renewed attention to shares of Bellatrix Exploration Ltd (BXE.TO). The current 14-day RSI is presently sitting at 34.09, the 7-day is 26.81, and the 3-day is 8.54. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index is a popular oscillating indicator among traders and investors. The RSI operates in a range-bound area with values between 0 and 100. When the RSI line moves up, the stock may be experiencing strength. The opposite is the case when the RSI line is heading lower. Different time periods may be used when using the RSI indicator. The RSI may be more volatile using a shorter period of time. Many traders keep an eye on the 30 and 70 marks on the RSI scale. A move above 70 is widely considered to show the stock as overbought, and a move below 30 would indicate that the stock may be oversold. Traders may use these levels to help identify stock price reversals.",287584269,2017-08-23 09:19:05,"Taking a Look Under the Hood at Bellatrix Exploration Ltd  BXE TO  Shares *** Taking a Look Under the Hood at Bellatrix Exploration Ltd BXE TO Shares  Concord RegisterFull coverage *** Taking a Look Under the Hood at Bellatrix Exploration Ltd (BXE.TO) Shares  August 23, 2017 Newswire  Chartists are paying particular close attention to shares of Bellatrix Exploration Ltd (BXE.TO) as the equity has touched the near-term bottom Bollinger Band, touching 2.85 on a recent trade.  Using this along with several other technical indicators can help investors understand if the shares will continue the downward momentum or bounce back up from the band.

A CCI reading above +100 would imply that the stock is overbought and possibly ready for a correction. On the other hand, a reading of -100 would imply that the stock is oversold and possibly set for a rally.  Traders are paying renewed attention to shares of Bellatrix Exploration Ltd (BXE.TO). The current 14-day RSI is presently sitting at 34.09, the 7-day is 26.81, and the 3-day is 8.54. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index is a popular oscillating indicator among traders and investors. The RSI operates in a range-bound area with values between 0 and 100. When the RSI line moves up, the stock may be experiencing strength. The opposite is the case when the RSI line is heading lower. Different time periods may be used when using the RSI indicator. The RSI may be more volatile using a shorter period of time. Many traders keep an eye on the 30 and 70 marks on the RSI scale. A move above 70 is widely considered to show the stock as overbought, and a move below 30 would indicate that the stock may be oversold. Traders may use these levels to help identify stock price reversals.",201734,"{u'neg': 0.0179999992251, u'neu': 0.865999996662, u'pos': 0.115000002086, u'compound': 0.997699975967}",0.997699975967

The Bollinger Band theory is designed to depict the volatility of a stock. It is quite basic, being composed of a simple moving average, and its upper and lower “bands” that are 2 standard deviations away. Standard deviations are a statistical tool used to contain the majority of movement or “deviation” around an average value. Bear in mind that when you use the Bollinger Band theory, it only works as a gauge or guide, and should be use with other indicators.  Traders generally use Bollinger Bands to determine overbought and oversold zones, to confirm divergences between prices and studies, and to project price targets. The wider the bands, the greater the volatility. The narrower the bands, the lesser the volatility.

A Williams %R that falls between -80 to -100 is typically viewed as being in strong oversold territory. A value between 0 to -20 would represent a strong overbought condition. As a momentum indicator, the Williams R% has the ability to be used with other technicals to help define a specific trend.  Bellatrix Exploration Ltd (BXE) presently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -145.54. Typically, the CCI oscillates above and below a zero line. Normal oscillations tend to stay in the range of -100 to +100. A CCI reading of +100 may represent overbought conditions, while readings near -100 may indicate oversold territory. Although the CCI indicator was developed for commodities, it has become a popular tool for equity evaluation as well.

Created by Thomas Aspray in 1986, the MACD Histogram is a visual indicator of the difference between the MACD line and the Signal line, which is a default 9 period ema of the MACD line. The histogram is an oscillator that moves above and below the zero line, just as the MACD line does. Keep in mind when using this oscillator, that it takes four mathematical steps from price itself to create the 4th derivative, the histogram: Price => two ema averages => MACD line = Signal line => Histogram. Which means it lags price quite a bit. But like all derivatives of price, it’s much smoother than price itself.  If the MACD is above zero it helps confirm an uptrend; below zero and it helps confirm a downtrend. Zero line and Signal line crossovers are used as trade signals to enter and exit trending trades. Losing trade signals occur when crossovers occur in rapid succession due to choppy price action. Divergence shows when momentum is slowing, but it doesn’t indicate when a reversal will occur (if it occurs). Combing different elements of each strategy makes the indicator more useful, such as taking buy signals following a bullish divergence. Using price and trend analysis will aid in determining which signals to take, such as only taking buy signals when a long-term uptrend is in place.  When undertaking stock analysis, investors and traders may choose to view some additional technical levels. Bellatrix Exploration Ltd (BXE) currently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -137.70. Investors and traders may use this indicator to help spot price reversals, price extremes, and the strength of a trend. Many investors will use the CCI in conjunction with other indicators when evaluating a trade. The CCI may be used to spot if a stock is entering overbought (+100) and oversold (-100) territory.  We can also do some further technical analysis on the stock. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Bellatrix Exploration Ltd (BXE) is 13.89. Many technical chart analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. The ADX is typically plotted along with two other directional movement indicator lines, the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI). Some analysts believe that the ADX is one of the best trend strength indicators available.  Interested investors may be watching the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. Williams %R is a popular technical indicator created by Larry Williams to help identify overbought and oversold situations. Investors will commonly use Williams %R in conjunction with other trend indicators to help spot possible stock turning points. Bellatrix Exploration Ltd (BXE)’s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R currently sits at -95.12. In general, if the indicator goes above -20, the stock may be considered overbought. Alternately, if the indicator goes below -80, this may point to the stock being oversold.  Tracking other technical indicators, the 14-day RSI is presently standing at 34.86, the 7-day sits at 25.06, and the 3-day is resting at 6.66. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is an often employed momentum oscillator that is used to measure the speed and change of stock price movements. When charted, the RSI can serve as a visual means to monitor historical and current strength or weakness in a certain market. This measurement is based on closing prices over a specific period of time. As a momentum oscillator, the RSI operates in a set range. This range falls on a scale between 0 and 100. If the RSI is closer to 100, this may indicate a period of stronger momentum. On the flip side, an RSI near 0 may signal weaker momentum. The RSI was originally created by J. Welles Wilder which was introduced in his 1978 book “New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems”.  For further review, we can take a look at another popular technical indicator. In terms of moving averages, the 200-day is currently at 3.65, the 50-day is 2.59, and the 7-day is resting at 2.37. Moving averages are a popular trading tool among investors. Moving averages can be used to help filter out the day to day noise created by other factors. MA’s may be used to identify uptrends or downtrends, and they can be a prominent indicator for detecting a shift in momentum for a particular stock.

Bowleven PLC (BLVN.L) currently has a 14 day Williams %R of -11.42. The Williams %R fluctuates between 0 and -100 measuring whether a security is overbought or oversold. The Williams %R is similar to the Stochastic Oscillator except it is plotted upside-down. Levels above -20 may indicate the stock may be considered is overbought. If the indicator travels under -80, this may signal that the stock is oversold. Chart analysts may also use the indicator to project possible price reversals and to define trends.  Another technical indicator that might serve as a powerful resource for measuring trend strength is the Average Directional Index or ADX. The ADX was introduced by J. Welles Wilder in the late 1970’s and it has stood the test of time. The ADX is typically used in conjunction with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to help spot trend direction as well as trend strength. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Bowleven PLC (BLVN.L) is noted at 38.11. Many technical analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal.  Investors may use various technical indicators to help spot trends and buy/sell signals. Presently, Bowleven PLC (BLVN.L) has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of 61.59. The CCI was developed by Donald Lambert. The assumption behind the indicator is that investment instruments move in cycles with highs and lows coming at certain periodic intervals. The original guidelines focused on creating buy/sell signals when the reading moved above +100 or below -100. Traders may also use the reading to identify overbought/oversold conditions.  Taking a look at other technical levels, the 3-day RSI stands at 65.93, the 7-day sits at 66.45 and the 14-day (most common) is at 64.78. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is an often employed momentum oscillator that is used to measure the speed and change of stock price movements. When charted, the RSI can serve as a visual means to monitor historical and current strength or weakness in a certain market. This measurement is based on closing prices over a specific period of time. As a momentum oscillator, the RSI operates in a set range. This range falls on a scale between 0 and 100. If the RSI is closer to 100, this may indicate a period of stronger momentum. On the flip side, an RSI near 0 may signal weaker momentum. The RSI was originally created by J. Welles Wilder which was introduced in his 1978 book “New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems”.  Keeping an eye on Moving Averages, the 50-day is 26.79, the 200-day is at 28.92, and the 7-day is 29.24 for Bowleven PLC (BLVN.L). Moving averages have the ability to be used as a powerful indicator for technical stock analysis. Following multiple time frames using moving averages can help investors figure out where the stock has been and help determine where it may be possibly going. The simple moving average is a mathematical calculation that takes the average price (mean) for a given amount of time.  A certain stock price rally by itself may not be sufficient evidence when making important investing decisions. To understand whether buying a stock at a higher price is justified by its long-term return potential, it is necessary to keep the finger on the pulse of underlying fundamentals. Following the latest data may help investors make the tough portfolio decisions. Investors may also want to set personal financial goals to help ensure that they are staying on the proper track. Financial professionals may be debating if global economic growth appears to be in a modest uptrend. This may have investors scrambling to study if developing markets are indeed growing with developed markets. This year could end up being the first year in a while where this has happened.

Smart investors are often very knowledgeable about the markets. Many successful investors have become highly adept at knowing when to buy and when to sell. They have also managed to control risk and secure sustained profits. This doesn’t just happen overnight. Investors often spend many years of trial and error before being able to put together the puzzle. Top investors are also able to make better investing decisions with the information at hand. With vast amounts of data readily available for everyone, it becomes more about interpreting the data rather than just receiving it. Knowing how to block out the noise and find information that is useful, can be a highly coveted skill. Turning available information into a winning portfolio is where the good investor can become a great investor.  Now let’s take a look at how the fundamentals are stacking up for Bowleven PLC (BLVN.L). Fundamental analysis takes into consideration market, industry and stock conditions to help determine if the shares are correctly valued. Bowleven PLC currently has a yearly EPS of 2.90. This number is derived from the total net income divided by shares outstanding. In other words, EPS reveals how profitable a company is on a share owner basis.  Another key indicator that can help investors determine if a stock might be a quality investment is the Return on Equity or ROE. Bowleven PLC (BLVN.L) currently has Return on Equity of 2.69. ROE is a ratio that measures profits generated from the investments received from shareholders. In other words, the ratio reveals how effective the firm is at turning shareholder investment into company profits. A company with high ROE typically reflects well on management and how well a company is run at a high level. A firm with a lower ROE might encourage potential investors to dig further to see why profits aren’t being generated from shareholder money.  Another ratio we can look at is the Return on Invested Capital or more commonly referred to as ROIC. Bowleven PLC (BLVN.L) has a current ROIC of 1.70. ROIC is calculated by dividing Net Income – Dividends by Total Capital Invested.  Similar to ROE, ROIC measures how effectively company management is using invested capital to generate company income. A high ROIC number typically reflects positively on company management while a low number typically reflects the opposite.  Turning to Return on Assets or ROA, Bowleven PLC (BLVN.L) has a current ROA of 1.66. This is a profitability ratio that measures net income generated from total company assets during a given period. This ratio reveals how quick a company can turn it’s assets into profits. In other words, the ratio provides insight into the profitability of a firm’s assets. The ratio is calculated by dividing total net income by the average total assets. A higher ROA compared to peers in the same industry, would suggest that company management is able to effectively generate profits from their assets. Similar to the other ratios, a lower number might raise red flags about management’s ability when compared to other companies in a similar sector.  Investors may be trying to define which trends will prevail in the second half of the year. As the markets continue to chug along, investors may be trying to maximize gains and become better positioned for success. Technical analysts may be studying different historical price and volume data in order to help uncover where the momentum is headed. Coming up with a solid strategy may take some time, but it might be well worth it in the long run. As we move deeper into the year, investors will be closely tracking the next few earnings periods.

All of those are fair points open to discussion, but not one of them will really matter if Chayce Crouch turns out to be a bust at quarterback. Or if his backup, Jeff George Jr., can’t deliver passes on time and on target.The quality of the defensive line may seem hugely important right now, but the fact is Illinois has not fielded a truly good football team in the last 50 years that wasn’t operated by a truly good quarterback.Admittedly, it’s not an overwhelming list of teams to consider. In those 50 years Illinois has fielded 15 bowl teams and a couple of those would probably not qualify as “truly good.”Go back to 1983 when Mike White was the coach and no one would argue that Jack Trudeau wasn’t a good quarterback. Trudeau threw for 8,146 yards and 51 touchdowns at Illinois and was a second-round draft pick of the Indianapolis Colts.That Illini team went to the Rose Bowl, even if it did lay an egg in Padadena, losing 45-9.Still, very good Illini team, very good quarterback.John Mackovic’s stay as head coach lasted four seasons and he fielded bowl teams every year. Mackovic’s 1989 team went 10-2 with Jeff George Sr. quarterbacking Illinois to a 31-21 victory over Virginia in the Citrus Bowl. George, as we know, was the No. 1 pick in the 1990 NFL draft.Very good Illini team, very good quarterback.The next season Illinois (8-4) went to the Hall of Fame Bowl in Tampa where Jason Verduzco was the quarterback in a 30-0 loss to Clemson.Pretty good Illini team, pretty good quarterback.Lou Tepper’s best team went 7-5 in 1994 and beat East Carolina in the Liberty Bowl with Johnny Johnson at quarterback.Pretty good Illini team, pretty good quarterback.  Ron Turner produced two bowl teams, both with Kurt Kittner at quarterback. In 1999 Illinois was 8-4 and beat Virginia 63-21 in the Micronpc.com Bowl in Miami. And in 2001, Kittner was sensational in leading Illinois to a 10-2 record and a tie for the Big Ten title before losing to LSU 47-34 in the Sugar Bowl.Two very good Illini teams led by one very good quarterback.Ron Zook shocked the nation when his 2007 Illini team went 9-4 and jetted off to the Rose Bowl, where it lost to Southern California 49-17. Juice Williams was the quarterback.Surprisingly good Illini team, pretty darned good quarterback.Finally, Zook’s final two teams wiggled into the bowl picture and each team finished 7-6. The 2010 team won its bowl game against Baylor and the 2011 team won its bowl game against UCLA. In each case, Nathan Scheelhaase was the QB.  Decent teams with a quarterback who was better than decent.Yes, Tim Beckman did field a bowl team. That was 2014 when quarterback Reilly O’Toole rode to the rescue once Wes Lunt was injured, beating Penn State and Northwestern in the final two regular-season games to earn a spot in the Heart of Dallas Bowl. There Illinois lost to Louisiana Tech, 35-18.O’Toole gets credit for doing all that he could, but the quarterback situation was a mad scramble as the 6-7 record would indicate.One season with Bill Cubit as interim head coach and one under Smith were quarterback scrambles, too, with Lunt fighting inconsistency and injuries and Crouch getting hurt last season as well.So here we are. It’s Crouch’s turn and there might be enough weapons on offense to create some fireworks. Those freshmen receivers look awfully good.We just need to see Crouch light the fuse. No one questions his toughness or his ability to run the ball, but there’s not enough evidence to know if he can effectively and safely operate the passing game. He’ll have to if Illinois is going to have a chance.We won’t know until it matters on Sept. 2 against Ball State. And the real tests come the next two games against South Florida and Western Kentucky, each of which won 11 games in 2016.The best thing that could happen is that in November, there’s a genuine debate about the effectiveness of Smith’s young defensive line. That would mean the quarterback play has been good enough so those other things still matter.A lot is riding on the quarterback. It always is.

Ron Turner produced two bowl teams, both with Kurt Kittner at quarterback. In 1999 Illinois was 8-4 and beat Virginia 63-21 in the Micronpc.com Bowl in Miami. And in 2001, Kittner was sensational in leading Illinois to a 10-2 record and a tie for the Big Ten title before losing to LSU 47-34 in the Sugar Bowl.Two very good Illini teams led by one very good quarterback.Ron Zook shocked the nation when his 2007 Illini team went 9-4 and jetted off to the Rose Bowl, where it lost to Southern California 49-17. Juice Williams was the quarterback.Surprisingly good Illini team, pretty darned good quarterback.Finally, Zook’s final two teams wiggled into the bowl picture and each team finished 7-6. The 2010 team won its bowl game against Baylor and the 2011 team won its bowl game against UCLA. In each case, Nathan Scheelhaase was the QB.  Decent teams with a quarterback who was better than decent.Yes, Tim Beckman did field a bowl team. That was 2014 when quarterback Reilly O’Toole rode to the rescue once Wes Lunt was injured, beating Penn State and Northwestern in the final two regular-season games to earn a spot in the Heart of Dallas Bowl. There Illinois lost to Louisiana Tech, 35-18.O’Toole gets credit for doing all that he could, but the quarterback situation was a mad scramble as the 6-7 record would indicate.One season with Bill Cubit as interim head coach and one under Smith were quarterback scrambles, too, with Lunt fighting inconsistency and injuries and Crouch getting hurt last season as well.So here we are. It’s Crouch’s turn and there might be enough weapons on offense to create some fireworks. Those freshmen receivers look awfully good.We just need to see Crouch light the fuse. No one questions his toughness or his ability to run the ball, but there’s not enough evidence to know if he can effectively and safely operate the passing game. He’ll have to if Illinois is going to have a chance.We won’t know until it matters on Sept. 2 against Ball State. And the real tests come the next two games against South Florida and Western Kentucky, each of which won 11 games in 2016.The best thing that could happen is that in November, there’s a genuine debate about the effectiveness of Smith’s young defensive line. That would mean the quarterback play has been good enough so those other things still matter.A lot is riding on the quarterback. It always is.

250,google_news_rss,Why Gus Malzahn sees preseason injuries as  a blessing  for Auburn football,Sun, 20 Aug 2017 20:06:08 GMT,BOWLEVEN PLC,https://www.seccountry.com/auburn/preseason-injuries-to-key-starters-a-blessing-for-auburn-football-in-2017,Why Gus Malzahn sees preseason injuries as a blessing for Auburn football  SECcountry comFull coverage,"Why Gus Malzahn sees preseason injuries as ‘a blessing’ for Auburn football  Auburn defensive lineman Nick Coe has gotten extra repetitions this fall after stepping in for an injured Marlon Davidson.  Benjamin Wolk/SEC Country  Lauren Shute  Posted 3 days ago  AUBURN, Ala. — Auburn football coach Gus Malzahn understands that injuries are bound to happen during the course of fall camp. It’s not something he looks forward to, but he has come to appreciate that the accidental bumps and bruises may actually benefit his program. “Anytime you go through fall camp and it’s physical, you’re going to have some nicks and stuff like that,” he said. “But I’ll tell you what it does, it also helps you develop depth.  “It gives some guys that may be with the twos get a chance to see how they respond with the ones. I think that will be a blessing as far as moving forward in a season and get that experience. There’s nothing like being out there with the first group and seeing how they respond.” For example, a non-contact knee injury to sophomore Marlon Davidson put defensive lineman Nick Coe front and center. There was no better way for the coaching staff to evaluate the redshirt freshman. Coe practiced with the second-team throughout the 2016 season and he didn’t play in a game. This preseason has been different because of Davidson’s injury. Coe earned praised from coaches for his work with the first team and Davidson even compared Coe to Myles Garrett, the No. 1 overall pick by the Cleveland Browns in the 2017 NFL Draft out of Texas A&M. RELATED: Marlon Davidson, others ‘back in some capacity’ for Auburn football “Nick is a freak of nature,” Davidson said. “Like the real deal. I look at him like Myles Garrett. He can really do it all. … It’s weird how long he’s come. He was just a little stick man coming in. Little, nothing. He grew a lot.” Safeties Tray Matthews and Daniel Thomas and defensive lineman Andrew Williams also missed a few days during camp. But Auburn’s staff knows what they’re getting from Matthews, the CEO of the defense, and Thomas, a standout underclassman who emerged when he stepped in for senior Rudy Ford in the 2016 Iron Bowl. Even Williams provided depth for the Tigers’ defensive line last season.  Instead, coaches turned their attention to others with fewer first-team reps, such as Jason Smith. The quarterback-turned-receiver-turned-defensive back caught Malzahn’s eye. “Jason’s got a lot of reps, now. He has got a whole lot of reps and I think he’s done some good things,” Malzahn said. “One thing that stands out to me, he’s got a nose for the ball now. He’s one of those heat-seeking missiles now. He’ll go, and he’s got courage. I think he’s gotten better at tackling. He’s got a lot of experience.” Perhaps the best part of the situation for Auburn is that those who’ve suffered minor injuries were “back in some capacity” for the team’s final scrimmage. The Tigers are closing in on their Sept. 2 home opener against Georgia Southern and Malzahn expects every defensive player to be available for the first game in Jordan-Hare Stadium — and to be better for the adversity navigated during fall camp.

With the oil price plunging from $115 in June 2014 to around $50 today, the share price fallout could have been far more brutal than it has been.Barrel of funWhen oil peaked in the summer of 2014, BP traded at 520p. Today it stands at 442p, a drop of just 15%. BP has overhauled its operations to ensure it can survive in an era of cheap oil, but it hasnt been easy. It still needs a break-even price of $60 a barrel but is currently well short of that, with Brent Crude trading at $51.68.The good news is that BP is restoring its free cash flows, which were inevitably savaged by the oil crash. In the 12 months to June they were a massive negative at -$4.1bn, but this conceals a recent improvement, with a positive $709m in the final three months. BP has promised a material improvement in second half cash flow as production begins at new upstream projects.In the year 2021The medium term looks even better, with BP recently upgrading its outlook to predict free cash flow of $13bn-$14bn from upstream operations by 2021 and a further $9bn-$10bn downstream. This assumes Brent Crude at $55 a barrel, a 5% rise in output and declining unit production costs. BP, which starts seven new projects this year, expects total production to rise by another 1m barrels a day by 2021.Chief executive Bob Dudley is targeting a break-even price of $40 a barrel in 2021, which he reckons will be sufficient to cover both spending and dividends. To do this, he will limit capital spending to a maximum $17bn a year. This would put BP in a strong sustainable position, particularly if the oil price picks up. Despite the challenge from renewables, battery storage, electric cars and so on, I reckon the oil age still has some way to run.Backwardation to the futureThere have been some bullish signals lately, with US crude inventories falling in recent weeks, supply threats in Libya, and a small drop in the shale rig count, as reported by Baker Hughes. Shale drillers are using less frac sand as the price rises, which suggests a dip in production.In another positive sign, the Brent futures curve has moved into backwardation. Near-term oil futures are now trading at a premium to longer-term contracts for the first time in years, which analysts say may be a sign that the oil market is rebalancing at last. Well see.Turn, BP, turnBP appears to have survived the worst, and with its dividend still intact. Its forecast yield is a gushing 6.8% for 2018. Earnings per share are forecast to rise by a mighty 4,297% across 2017, reducing BPs valuation to just 20.8 times earnings. 2016s £2.29bn loss is expected to turn into a 2017 profit of £6.95bn, then top £9bn in 2018. Deepwater scars are slowly fading.Again, well see. The oil price could grind lower, shocks can always happen.

259,google_news_rss,One FTSE 100 dividend stock I d buy instead of BP plc,Tue, 22 Aug 2017 10:01:12 GMT,BP PLC,https://www.aol.co.uk/money/2017/08/22/one-ftse-100-dividend-stock-id-buy-instead-of-bp-plc/,One FTSE 100 dividend stock I d buy instead of BP plc  AOL UKFull coverage,"Home  One FTSE 100 dividend stock Id buy instead of BP plc  By The Motley Fool  22 Aug 2017, 11:01  Updated: 22 Aug 2017, 11:16  -  If youre buying a dividend stock, youll often be forced to choose between quality and quantity.This is very much the case in the commodity sector at the moment. At the quantity end of the scale are companies such as BP (LSE: BP), whose shares currently offer a forecast yield of 6.9%.The problem with this payout is that it hasnt been covered by earnings since 2014. And broker forecasts suggest it wont be covered in 2017 either. Paying dividends without free cash flow or earnings cover means that a company must draw on its cash reserves or borrow more money.In BPs case, dividend payments are one of the reasons why the groups net debt has risen from $22.8m in 2014, to $39.8m at the end of June. This represents a multiple of 6.9 times analysts forecast 2017 earnings of $5.8bn. Thats quite a lot of debt.Although I dont expect this borrowing binge to result in financial distress, there is a modest risk of a dividend cut. Even without this, Im not convinced BPs share price offers that much upside. The stock currently trades on a forecast P/E of 20, falling to a P/E of 15 in 2018. In my view, the price of oil will need to surge higher to generate further gains.If I owned this stock for income, Id continue to hold. But if I was looking for a high quality mix of growth and income, Id consider my next stock.Profits are rocketingShares of Chile-based copper miner Antofagasta (LSE: ANTO) rose by 5% to 1,000p this morning after reporting an 88% increase in profits for the first half of the year.The FTSE 100 group said that earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose by 87.8% to $1,079.8m during the six-month period as copper prices rose by 25% and sales volumes rose by 14%.Antofagastas soaring profits highlight the firms key attractions -- low costs and high profit margins. The groups net cash costs for the period were $1.24/lb, compared with an average copper sale price of $2.72/lb. This resulted in the group reporting an impressive operating profit margin of 35%.Free cash flow for the period was $432m, almost exactly matching the groups half-year post-tax earnings of $455.6m. Thats a sign of high-quality profits, in my view. It enabled management to reduce net debt by 20% to $859m, while also increasing the interim dividend by 232%, to 10.3 cents per share.Todays upbeat figures were modestly ahead of expectations. The groups H1 earnings of 29.5 cents per share suggest to me that full-year forecasts of 51 cents per share may be upgraded. Dividend guidance may also improve slightly.However, Antofagastas rebound is basically what was expected from this company. Its a high quality business. And thats why it has always been an expensive stock, with a low dividend yield.The copper miners shares currently trade on a 2017 forecast P/E of about 24, with a prospective yield of about 1.6%. The income investor within me would rather buy BP, but I think theres a good chance that the total return from Antofagasta -- share price gains plus dividends -- could beat the returns from BP shares.5 dividend growth stocks Id buy todayIf youre building a portfolio of dividend stocks, then I believe its essential to diversify. After all, Antofagasta slashed its dividend payout last year, when copper prices slumped.That why Id consider investing in the stocks featured in 5 Shares To Retire On.

At the quantity end of the scale are companies such as BP (LSE: BP), whose shares currently offer a forecast yield of 6.9%.The problem with this payout is that it hasnt been covered by earnings since 2014. And broker forecasts suggest it wont be covered in 2017 either. Paying dividends without free cash flow or earnings cover means that a company must draw on its cash reserves or borrow more money.In BPs case, dividend payments are one of the reasons why the groups net debt has risen from $22.8m in 2014, to $39.8m at the end of June. This represents a multiple of 6.9 times analysts forecast 2017 earnings of $5.8bn. Thats quite a lot of debt.Although I dont expect this borrowing binge to result in financial distress, there is a modest risk of a dividend cut. Even without this, Im not convinced BPs share price offers that much upside. The stock currently trades on a forecast P/E of 20, falling to a P/E of 15 in 2018. In my view, the price of oil will need to surge higher to generate further gains.If I owned this stock for income, Id continue to hold. But if I was looking for a high quality mix of growth and income, Id consider my next stock.Profits are rocketingShares of Chile-based copper miner Antofagasta (LSE: ANTO) rose by 5% to 1,000p this morning after reporting an 88% increase in profits for the first half of the year.The FTSE 100 group said that earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose by 87.8% to $1,079.8m during the six-month period as copper prices rose by 25% and sales volumes rose by 14%.Antofagastas soaring profits highlight the firms key attractions -- low costs and high profit margins. The groups net cash costs for the period were $1.24/lb, compared with an average copper sale price of $2.72/lb. This resulted in the group reporting an impressive operating profit margin of 35%.Free cash flow for the period was $432m, almost exactly matching the groups half-year post-tax earnings of $455.6m. Thats a sign of high-quality profits, in my view. It enabled management to reduce net debt by 20% to $859m, while also increasing the interim dividend by 232%, to 10.3 cents per share.Todays upbeat figures were modestly ahead of expectations. The groups H1 earnings of 29.5 cents per share suggest to me that full-year forecasts of 51 cents per share may be upgraded. Dividend guidance may also improve slightly.However, Antofagastas rebound is basically what was expected from this company. Its a high quality business. And thats why it has always been an expensive stock, with a low dividend yield.The copper miners shares currently trade on a 2017 forecast P/E of about 24, with a prospective yield of about 1.6%. The income investor within me would rather buy BP, but I think theres a good chance that the total return from Antofagasta -- share price gains plus dividends -- could beat the returns from BP shares.5 dividend growth stocks Id buy todayIf youre building a portfolio of dividend stocks, then I believe its essential to diversify. After all, Antofagasta slashed its dividend payout last year, when copper prices slumped.That why Id consider investing in the stocks featured in 5 Shares To Retire On.

Sign up here to receive our newsletter.Reliance Industries Ltd., owned by India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, is considering entering the power-storage business with its partner BP Plc. to expand into the country’s growing renewable energy sector, according to two people with knowledge of the plan.The companies are considering a plan to set up energy-storage projects near solar- and wind-energy installations, the people said, asking not to be identified citing company policy. A decision on investment and implementation will be taken by December, they said.  Reliance didn’t respond to requests for comment. BP declined to comment.The push into power storage dovetails with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to boost the country’s reliance on renewable power and set it on track to sell only electric cars by 2030.Global oil majors such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA and Exxon Mobil Corp. are investing in new-energy technologies to improve electricity grids and develop fuels from renewable resources. Reliance has been seeking to enter the business since 2009, when it first announced plans for alternative-energy businesses.  Reliance and BP in June said they were extending their partnership to sell conventional fuels as well as explore opportunities in clean energy. Last month, the Mint newspaper reported that Reliance is planning to sell liquefied natural gas at its fuel-retailing outlets and set up charging stations for electric vehicles.India RenewablesLNG and electric-vehicle charging would be an extension of Reliance’s current retail fuel business, though the company hasn’t firmed up a business plan as the market is at a nascent stage, one of the people said.  India’s solar-power capacity has surged fourfold since December 2014 to about 13 gigawatts. Wind installations reached almost 33 gigawatts from 22.5 gigawatts over the same period.

From Trafalgar to St James’s Square, giant marine creatures floated along with a parade of passionate reef defenders, infecting people with joy and smiles. The air was filled with sounds of the ocean- with the odd intriguing whale call!! It definitely cheered people up on their commute around central.  Why did we do this?.. Well, BP currently have plans to drill near a 600 mile, newly documented coral reef near the mouth of the Amazon – which happens to be a brand new ecosystem. The area is already home to significant species, but as only 5% of the area has been mapped, it’s highly likely that many new ones exist.  I’ve been working on the Amazon Reef campaign for a few months now, and on Monday I finally got to see all our hard work in action. I joined like-minded Greenpeace activists from all over the UK, in a vibrant march to protest against BP.  BP’s plans bring the risk of an oil spill which could devastate this precious ecosystem and potentially wipe out these new species. Our success on that day may determine the future of the reef- so we were all ready to give it our all and tell BP to back off the Amazon Reef.  The reef defenders did a great job wowing the people of London- it’s not everyday you see a tropical fish parade marching around Trafalgar Square at 8am. It was a smooth show, we didn’t hold up traffic or cause ag to drivers. Instead, they seemed to be beeping at us in awe. They even took leaflets to find out what we were doing here!  We stayed in the area for an hour-ish, and along the way, stuck a letter on the door of the Brazilian Embassy, telling them how many people want to see drilling plans abandoned. Once we got to BP’s HQ, Sara (campaigner) delivered a treasure chest containing a petition letter addressed to the CEO, and messages from supporters.  I handed in a big map of the reef, as they’re clearly ignoring it. In BP’s Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), they completely missed out the Amazon Reef, as if it didn’t exist in the Amazon Mouth Basin. Although a more recent statement did address the reef, it just shows that they couldn’t be bothered to do another EIA! So, we brought the reef to their HQ, helping their staff visualise the reef, and refresh their conscience.  Just as we headed away from BP, the Boris Johnson himself appeared from the corner! We managed to chase after him and hand him a leaflet, informing him about the campaign. He said he hadn’t heard of the reef, but realised it was an ‘important issue’. Why can’t BP realise the significance of the Amazon Reef?  Our ultimate aim is to stop BP from drilling in the Amazon Mouth Basin, by creating public awareness of the threat to the reef posed by their plans. We also hope to spark conversations within the BP HQ and the Brazilian embassy; emphasising the dangers of oil drilling and its impact on the Amazon Reef.

Plaquemines Parish officials responded with a request that the demand be transferred to a state court in the parish, but on Monday asked the federal judge to delay a hearing on the case indefinitely as both sides discuss a settlement.  On Tuesday, the parish amended its request, asking the judge to delay a hearing on the fees until Sept. 13, while a federal clerk issued notes in the record pointing out that a pretrial order in the BP case prohibits the parish and its attorneys from setting hearing dates without permission of the judge. Attorney Scott Bickford, one of the attorneys hired by the parish thats seeking the fees, said Tuesday that there are no settlement discussions between the attorneys and the parish.  The Plaquemines Parish Council unanimously voted in April 2011 to hire the New Orleans law firm of Martzell & Bickford and New Orleans attorney David Landry to represent it in what turned out to be a lengthy battle with BP over the damage settlement. In August 2011, it added King, Krebs & Jurgens, a law firm with offices in New Orleans and Houston, to the team.  Under the terms of that agreement, the attorneys were to receive 15 percent of the first $15 million included in a settlement, 10 percent of any amount above $15 million, and would be paid its expenses from the net settlement amount. That works out to 12.7 percent of the $45 million settlement amount.  On the advice of the legal team, in July 2015, the late Parish President Amos Cormier Jr. recommended against participating in an omnibus settlement agreement between BP and federal, state and local government agencies, saying the $9 million offered the parish -- which experienced more oiling than most other coastal locations during the Deepwater Horizon spill -- was outrageous.  Cormier died in June 2016 and his son, Amos Cormier III, was elected to fill his position in December.  In May of this year, the younger Cormier announced that the parish had agreed to a $45 million settlement, which was almost five times what BP and a court neutral working on the government settlement originally recommended for the parish.  Under the settlement agreement, BP was to pay the parish the first $25 million of the settlement this year, and $5 million a year thereafter, with a first check of $15 million going to the attorneys on Aug. 1 for distribution.  After Parish Attorney Peter Barbee raised questions about whether the legal team was properly hired by the council, the team put the $6.4 million it says it is owed in an escrow account and forwarded the remaining $8.6 million to the parish.  In their filing with U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier, who oversaw the BP damage cases, the attorneys pointed out that the 12.7 percent contingency fee they should receive is significantly smaller than what attorneys representing other local governments were paid: Attorneys representing New Orleans were paid about 18 percent; Jefferson Parish, 22 percent, and St. Tammany, Terrebonne and Tangipahoa attorneys received 25 percent.  In an Aug. 7 letter to Cormier, attorney Scott Bickford said that he had supplied Barbee with documents showing that the council voted to approve the contract, and pointed out that then parish attorney Steve Braud had read the contingency fee terms of the contract into the record during the initial meeting when it was approved. A video of that meeting shows that Braud was requested to explain the contract after an audience member questioned whether the attorneys might receive a third of the settlement.  Bickford pointed out in his letter, which was attached to the attorneys federal court filing, that the attorneys were still representing the parish in continuing negotiations over a separate settlement with BP and other parties to the Deepwater Horizon accident concerning punitive damages.  Also included in the filings were the minutes from a Plaquemines Parish mid-year budget meeting, dated Aug. 7, in which Cormier said that neither he nor Barbee could find proof that the council had approved the contract.  Barbee said during that meeting that he expected the attorneys to shift to a second strategy of trying to go to just a formula based upon what they are going to claim theyve earned, but that would be a much reduce rate because frankly i dont know how they are going to justify. Even with the number of hours they told me they worked, it would be over $1,000 an hour which would be absurd to be paying.  In an Aug. 9 email to Barbee, Bickford pointed out that the attorneys actually invested more than $600,000 of their own money in moving forward with the case, and pointed out that the contingency fee terms were agreed to by the council as part of a request for qualifications, and that the team provided the lowest contingency fees of any parish which retained attorneys.  In the parishs motion to dismiss, filed Friday, Barbee argued that the contracts own language requires that any disputes be considered in the 25th Judicial District Court in the parish. But on Monday, Barbee instead asked for an indefinite continuance of any hearing on either the attorneys payment demand or the parishs dismissal motion.  He said the indefinite delay was recommended by both sides following a Sunday discussion by both sides until further communication from the parties. But on Tuesday, Barbee filed a new motion with the court only asking for a delay in a hearing on the fees until Sept. 13.  This story was updated on Tuesday (Aug. 22) to show that Plaquemines Parish filed a new motion asking for a delay of a hearing on the fees until Sept. 13, and that one of the attorneys demanding the fees said no negotiatons are under way between them and the parish.  . . . . . . .

He said the indefinite delay was recommended by both sides following a Sunday discussion by both sides until further communication from the parties. But on Tuesday, Barbee filed a new motion with the court only asking for a delay in a hearing on the fees until Sept. 13.  This story was updated on Tuesday (Aug. 22) to show that Plaquemines Parish filed a new motion asking for a delay of a hearing on the fees until Sept. 13, and that one of the attorneys demanding the fees said no negotiatons are under way between them and the parish.  . . . . . . .

Picture (Image: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images) Share CommentsThe Welford Road pitch is looking immaculate and the stands – including the new £8 million Robin Hood Stand – are ready for the roar of the season’s first Premiership game against Bath on September 3. The team behind the scenes at the Tigers have every right to claim the title of biggest rugby club in Britain. As well as investment in facilities, the Tigers have been boosting that profile with its revamped commercial operations. Overseen by commercial director Andrea Pinchen, Tigers restructured its commercial operations when it moved into new offices in the new stand. The idea was to make everything more streamlined so that sales, marketing and other operations were working together and cross-selling to clients, customers and sponsors. It has coincided with a push towards non-matchday events such as conferences and weddings, and ensuring that sponsors and fans are aware of the opportunities to use club facilities during the week.  Tigers commercial director and board member Andrea Pinchen  On top of taking care of day-to-day marketing operations and forward planning, Andrea is involved in discussions for a new hotel the club plans to build on the former Granby Halls site to the north of the ground. In turn, that move will take away significant matchday parking so, all being well, the club wants to pursue longstanding plans for a multi-storey car park on land on the opposite side of the stadium. She said: “We are aware that when building work starts on the hotel, the NCP will go, so we are looking into the opportunity of the multi-storey as well. “We are looking at work starting on the hotel in the first quarter of 2018, depending on the kind of building we decide on. “Then the plan will be to have the multi-storey on the Crumbie car park, with more than 400 spaces. “If the car park is a goer – and we will have to look at what finances are in place – it would happen over the next few years.”  Matt OConnor wants to carry Premiership momentum into Europe. Picture - David Rogers/Getty Images  Andrea has been at the Tigers since January 2004, starting out as ticketing sales manager, and joining the board in 2014. The investment is all part of the club’s aim to build its business potential on the back of its on-pitch success. She said: “In our match day programmes and ads we are doing more to promote the fact that we do corporate events like Christmas parties, exhibitions and conferences. “We are getting that message across and that has led to more weekday events. “We are very busy during the week now with a diverse range of things, a lot of Asian weddings for instance and big awards events. “There are also conferences for big multi-nationals, and Christmas parties which we make sure we talk to matchday clients about. “That side of the business has grown quite significantly and we will be having more Christmas parties this year than last year. They are a big growth area.” The Welford Road ground has a big exhibition hall, two main conference rooms as well as other meeting rooms and 25 corporate boxes which are all available for business use. With the huge amounts top level rugby now attracts, there had been a big rise in the amount of sponsorship income coming in too – even after Caterpillar pulled its club sponsorship a year ago.  Action from Tigers pre-season win against Treviso  Over the past three years, she said, there had been a 28 per cent growth in income from stand and shirt sponsorship. She said: “We are not looking for a record number of partners, but rather a record level of investment. “Last year was the first year without Caterpillar as a partner for eight years. “They were our main sponsor and we were at the contract stage for another five year deal, but when austerity kicked in for them there was a stop on spending in those sorts of areas. “That announcement came in November 2015 so we had a maximum of six months to find a new main sponsor. “Caterpillar were a really good business to work with. “Their Desford headquarters is responsible for Europe, Africa and the Middle East and a lot of foreign business people came over to the UK with them and took the rugby back. “But because they had exclusivity on the kit – which looked great and clean – it also meant it was quite vulnerable. “So with them going we decided to split sponsorship on the kit, to drive revenue, and we are getting more for the kits than before.” Today Holland and Barratt is the main shirt partner, with German power tools specialist Stihl on the sleeves, and branding for Breedon Group, Fischer Future Heat, Leo Vegas, Mattioli Woods and Kukri Sports.  Ben White added two late tries for Tigers. Picture - Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images  Andrea said: “What we’ve tried to do is not only break the kit down but do contracts for different lengths of time, so that we are not vulnerable to any sponsor leaving in any one season.” She said juggling so many strands of the business was hugely challenging. The total sales side is 68-strong and covers everything from ticket sales to community work, global delivery, marketing and communications – and goes right up to chief executive Simon Cohen. She said: “One of the cross-overs between the playing side and business side is that we are all here to win and whether you are a rugby player or in sales or marketing you have got to be at the top of your game because the expectation of a club like Tigers is that you have to perform to the best of your ability. “The team on the commercial side are the best people I have worked with and we have a clear three-year commercial strategy that everyone is aware of.” Andrea said there were two main areas of growth being targeted over the next three years – tickets and sponsorship. The 25,856 capacity stadium attracts an average of 22,000 fans a match, and the club sells around 14,500 season tickets.  Leicester Tigers ground  (Image: Will Johnston)  She said: “We had the most people through the gate ever last season and want to continue that good work. “It’s important that we don’t forget our home fans so want to do work in the community with our foundation, which in turn will attract more people to the club. “We’ve got room to grow and it’s important we do that while making sure we deliver an entertaining product that people enjoy and bring the next generation along to. “We would define ourselves as the biggest club in the UK as far as our supporter base. “Our support is huge and massively loyal.

The Ichimoku cloud is a favorite technical indicator used primarily in Asian markets. The cloud is one of the only indicators that is both forward and backward looking. The cloud produces better levels of support and resistance and is a breakout trader’s best friend. The cloud is also one of the easiest indicators to use. Any trader, regardless of skill level or expertise, can use the cloud to quickly and efficiently analyze any product on any time frame. The cloud shines in the fact that it can be universally applied to any trading plan by any trader.  It is a type of chart used in technical analysis to display support and resistance, momentum, and trend in one view. TenkanSen and KijunSen are similar to moving averages and analyzed in relationship to one another. When the shorter term indicator, TenkanSen, rises above the longer term indicator, KijunSen, the securities trend is typically positive. When TenkanSen falls below KijunSen, the securities trend is typically negative. TenkanSen and KijunSen as a group are then analyzed in relationship to the Cloud, which is composed of the area between Senkou A and Senkou B. A multi-faceted indicator designed to give support/resistance levels, trend direction, and entry/exit points of varying strengths. General theory behind this indicator states that if price action is above the cloud, the overall trend is bullish, and if below the cloud, the overall trend is bearish. There are also moving averages (the Tenkan and Kijun lines) which act like the MACD crossover signals with the Tenkan crossing from underneath the Kijun as a bullish signal, while crossing overhead giving a bearish signal.  Investing in the stock market may include having to keep emotions in check. When things get crazy, investors may be forced with tough decisions. Being able to stay away from impulsive decisions may help when the time comes to tweak the portfolio. Having the proper discipline and market perspective may also be a highly desirable trait for a successful trader. Investors who are able to practice discipline may be able to avoid emotional trading pitfalls in the future. Even highly experienced investors may have to someday make the difficult decisions in order to keep the portfolio strong. Figuring out what works and what doesn’t may take many years of trial and error. Learning to filter through the daily noise can be a big asset when trying to focus on the particularly important information.  Checking on some popular technical levels, Breedon Group PLC (BREE.L) has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -112.08. The CCI technical indicator can be employed to help figure out if a stock is entering overbought or oversold territory. CCI may also be used to help discover divergences that may signal reversal moves. A CCI closer to +100 may provide an overbought signal, and a CCI near -100 may provide an oversold signal.  Tracking other technical indicators, the 14-day RSI is presently standing at 44.26, the 7-day sits at 28.35, and the 3-day is resting at 19.07 for Breedon Group PLC (BREE.L). The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a highly popular technical indicator. The RSI is computed base on the speed and direction of a stock’s price movement. The RSI is considered to be an internal strength indicator, not to be confused with relative strength which is compared to other stocks and indices. The RSI value will always move between 0 and 100. One of the most popular time frames using RSI is the 14-day.  Moving averages have the ability to be used as a powerful indicator for technical stock analysis. Following multiple time frames using moving averages can help investors figure out where the stock has been and help determine where it may be possibly going. The simple moving average is a mathematical calculation that takes the average price (mean) for a given amount of time. Currently, the 7-day moving average is sitting at 89.21.  Let’s take a further look at the Average Directional Index or ADX. The ADX measures the strength or weakness of a particular trend. Investors and traders may be looking to figure out if a stock is trending before employing a specific trading strategy. The ADX is typically used along with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) which point to the direction of the trend. The 14-day ADX for Breedon Group PLC (BREE.L) is currently at 36.91. In general, and ADX value from 0-25 would represent an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would support a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would signify a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would point to an extremely strong trend.",287584269,2017-08-21 07:18:45,"Breedon Group PLC  BREE L  Ichimoku Levels Indicate Solid Momentum *** Breedon Group PLC BREE L Ichimoku Levels Indicate Solid Momentum  Rives JournalFull coverage *** Breedon Group PLC (BREE.L) Ichimoku Levels Indicate Solid Momentum  August 22, 2017 Rives Staff Writer  Shares of Breedon Group PLC (BREE.L) opened the last session at $88.75, touching a high of $89.00 and a low of $88.00 , yielding a change of -0.75.  The latest reading places the stock above the Ichimoku cloud which indicates positive momentum and a potential buy signal for the equity.

Leading up to the college football season kickoff, we will give you previews of the 25 teams that you, the readers, voted to be most worthy of writing about. Now, No. 24 Tennessee. For a brief period of time, Tennessee was the No. 1 team in the Deadspin 25. I know, hard to believe you scumbag readers would vote such a vile program so high, but it’s true. The Volunteers bested the next closest competitor by garnering nearly 25 percent more votes through the opening 24 hours; they seemed well on their way to making their first ever top-10 appearance in the One True Poll. Unfortunately for Butch Jones’s squad, they did what they always do: choked when it mattered most. Sure, they still made the rankings, but all the potential, all the hope was dashed as soon as they threw their names in the hat, because destiny does not play favorites, not even with the reigning Champions of Life.AdvertisementThe Volunteers have been a confounding squad, really, ever since Phillip Fulmer got canned—they consistently cobble together top-15 recruiting classes,  boast a crazed fanbase, and appear to have a coach at the helm that is a perfect fit among the SEC’s two-deep roster of weirdos with confounding haircuts. And yet, even with access to the nation’s best recruits thanks to their storied history and  SEC Network money, Tennessee consistently spends its seasons, in no particular order, 1) proving it has the talent to hang with anyone and 2) defecating in their own bed sheets. Last season, the Volunteers burst out of the gates, winning five straight games to open the season. And the wins didn’t come in blowout fashion—they required an insanely lucky bounce in overtime to down (a very good!) App State, came back from 21-0 to beat Florida, and leaned on last-minute heroics to rip out Georgia’s heart. But the thing is, as exciting as it is to watch a team repeatedly tell death to fuck off, chances are two things about such a team are true: They’re probably more talented and lucky than genuinely great, and that team’s magic will eventually dissipate. For Tennessee, that time came in Week 6. And again in Week 7. The nail in the coffin  came in Week 8, when lowly South Carolina downed the Volunteers 24-21, stamping out any remaining division title dreams and spurring star running back Jalen Hurd to announce his intentions to transfer.Hurd is an interesting case—through his first two seasons, he was a clear-cut NFL prospect, rushing for 2,187 yards and 17 touchdowns and hauling in 57 passes for 411 yards and four scores. His production dipped last year, though, as in the seven games he played, he posted just 451 rushing yards and 3 scores to pair with 81 receiving yards and two touchdowns while dealing with a rash of undisclosed injuries (per the Tennessean, Jones vaguely said he had both upper and lower body injuries; his stepdad said he had a concussion.) After the Volunteers somehow lost to the Gamecocks, Hurd called it quits and later committed to Baylor.AdvertisementI realize this is a situation that requires a delicate, balanced analysis but... imagine being such a frustrating program that one of your premier offensive weapons stops giving a single shit about your team, announces his intention to transfer halfway through the season, and then agrees to sit out a year to transfer to fucking Baylor. That’s the most satisfaction Gator fans have gotten since whenever they last spent an afternoon watching ‘08 Tebow highlights.As much of a shitshow as the Hurd ordeal was, the Volunteer offense is actually in decent shape as far as its 2017 running back situation goes. Starting quarterback Josh Dobbs and running backs Hurd and Alvin Kamara have since bid Knoxville adieu (Dobbs and Kamara are suiting up for NFL teams nowadays), but junior John Kelly is primed to fill in as the new feature back. Despite topping 10 carries just five times last season, the stout speedster broke out to establish himself as the next man up, racking up 630 yards  and reaching paydirt six times. Having stability there will be a much-needed relief for whoever ends up under center.As of Aug. 11, junior Quinten Dormaday and redshirt freshman Jarret Guarantano, who have a combined 39 thrown passes (all Dormaday’s), are battling for the quarterback spot, with Jones keeping a tight seal on which of the two he might be leaning toward for the Sept. 4 season opener. Dormaday was reportedly the favorite heading into camp, per 24/7, but Jones won’t say whether the upperclassman has the upper hand yet or not. AdvertisementWhoever does get the nod will assuredly be throwing a lot of balls to receiver Jauan Jennings, the guy that fucked Georgia all the way up and finished with 40 receptions, 580 yards, and seven scores in 2016. With the incredibly efficient Josh Malone gone, Jennings will be the No. 1 option for the Volunteers; some other guys will also catch balls, but it’s unclear who will actually start or be any good. The Volunteers have sophomore Tyler Byrd, who posted 13 catches and 209 yards last year, as well as redshirt senior Josh Smith (though he’s injured at the moment) and sophomores Brandon Johnson and Marquez Callaway—the trio combined for a whopping 213 yards and two scores last year. Rookie Brandon Johnson has reportedly started to climb the depth chart, too. The reality is that there’s a decent amount of talent here, but none of it has turned up for a full season’s worth of production—you’ll be shocked to know this problem is not unique to the offense.Defensive coordinator Bob Shoop had to deal with a rash of injuries in his first year at Tennessee, resulting in his group becoming the No. 1 reason the team failed to achieve anything meaningful. Heading into his second season, he has to deal with being sued for nearly a million bucks by his old team, Penn State—life’s tough that way, I guess. Personnel-wise, his 2017 defensive line and secondary will be as talented and inexperienced as pretty much every offensive Tennessee position group, as Shoop has to replace 20 combined sacks after losing ends Derek Barnett and Corey Vereen. Redshirt sophomore Darrell Taylor and redshirt junior Jonathan Kongbo should get the job done, and it’ll help that the Volunteers linebacker core will feature a trio of seniors in Elliott Berry, Colton Jumper, and Cortez McDowell. But consistency is not always a recipe for success.While the Tennessee offense hummed for the majority of last season, the defense sucked eggs, giving up 28.8 points per game. If that turns out to not be an aberration, then Shoop will not be long for Knoxville. Ole Butch wasn’t scared to fire John Jancek in 2015 despite the fact the Volunteer ranked 17th in the nation with 20.0 points allowed; if Shoop wants to comfortably pay off that pesky suit, the Volunteer defense had better figure out how to to turn all these dang four-star recruits into, you know, an actual defense.  A Guy To KnowGiven the Volunteers enter the season with a new quarterback, receiving corps, defensive line, and secondary, one of their rare proven entities will unsurprisingly be their best shot at recreating what was at times one of the most entertaining and efficient offensive attacks in the nation. Although  Hurd and Kamara are gone, the Volunteers should rest easy knowing that John Kelly will carry the yeoman’s load in 2017.AdvertisementA three-star recruit out of Michigan, Kelly was never particularly expected to become this season’s feature back with Hurd and Kamara ahead of him on the depth chart. He spent his freshman year on clean-up duty, watching from the sidelines as the duo combined for over 1,900 yards. For the first part of the 2016 campaign, it appeared as though Kelly would serve in the same role, as he didn’t even register a handoff in two of the first seven games. But after Hurd’s transfer and an injury to Kamara forced him into action, Kelly proved to be even more efficient, rushing for 6.4 yards per carry and topping 80 yards four times. At 5-foot-9 and 205 pounds, Kelly is a balanced runner that manages to always keep his momentum headed upfield by mixing in an array of quick side-step moves that allow him to brush off defenders attempting to bring him down without wrapping up. He has inexperience behind him on the depth chart in sophomore Carlin Fils-Aime and incoming four-star recruit Ty Chandler, so barring any surprises from those two, Kelly will be expected to to handle the majority of carries this year; while that may cause concern at other position groups, here, the Volunteers actually got lucky.Can They Make The Playoff?With this weak-ass nonconference schedule, who knows? Tennessee, a major Power Five program, has the following list of non-SEC opponents: Georgia Tech, Southern Miss, UMass, Indiana State.

AdvertisementPointless gripes aside, the Volunteers really don’t have a shot. While plenty of starters have logged years of practice play, there’s way too much inexperience across the board; even if the offensive newcomers prove to be decent, unless the defense gets its shit together in a very real and immediate way, which I don’t think it will, the entire conversation is moot.

Leading up to the college football season kickoff, we will give you previews of the 25 teams that you, the readers, voted to be most worthy of writing about. Now, No. 24 Tennessee. For a brief period of time, Tennessee was the No. 1 team in the Deadspin 25. I know, hard to believe you scumbag readers would vote such a vile program so high, but it’s true. The Volunteers bested the next closest competitor by garnering nearly 25 percent more votes through the opening 24 hours; they seemed well on their way to making their first ever top-10 appearance in the One True Poll. Unfortunately for Butch Jones’s squad, they did what they always do: choked when it mattered most. Sure, they still made the rankings, but all the potential, all the hope was dashed as soon as they threw their names in the hat, because destiny does not play favorites, not even with the reigning Champions of Life.AdvertisementThe Volunteers have been a confounding squad, really, ever since Phillip Fulmer got canned—they consistently cobble together top-15 recruiting classes,  boast a crazed fanbase, and appear to have a coach at the helm that is a perfect fit among the SEC’s two-deep roster of weirdos with confounding haircuts. And yet, even with access to the nation’s best recruits thanks to their storied history and  SEC Network money, Tennessee consistently spends its seasons, in no particular order, 1) proving it has the talent to hang with anyone and 2) defecating in their own bed sheets. Last season, the Volunteers burst out of the gates, winning five straight games to open the season. And the wins didn’t come in blowout fashion—they required an insanely lucky bounce in overtime to down (a very good!) App State, came back from 21-0 to beat Florida, and leaned on last-minute heroics to rip out Georgia’s heart. But the thing is, as exciting as it is to watch a team repeatedly tell death to fuck off, chances are two things about such a team are true: They’re probably more talented and lucky than genuinely great, and that team’s magic will eventually dissipate. For Tennessee, that time came in Week 6. And again in Week 7. The nail in the coffin  came in Week 8, when lowly South Carolina downed the Volunteers 24-21, stamping out any remaining division title dreams and spurring star running back Jalen Hurd to announce his intentions to transfer.Hurd is an interesting case—through his first two seasons, he was a clear-cut NFL prospect, rushing for 2,187 yards and 17 touchdowns and hauling in 57 passes for 411 yards and four scores. His production dipped last year, though, as in the seven games he played, he posted just 451 rushing yards and 3 scores to pair with 81 receiving yards and two touchdowns while dealing with a rash of undisclosed injuries (per the Tennessean, Jones vaguely said he had both upper and lower body injuries; his stepdad said he had a concussion.) After the Volunteers somehow lost to the Gamecocks, Hurd called it quits and later committed to Baylor.AdvertisementI realize this is a situation that requires a delicate, balanced analysis but... imagine being such a frustrating program that one of your premier offensive weapons stops giving a single shit about your team, announces his intention to transfer halfway through the season, and then agrees to sit out a year to transfer to fucking Baylor. That’s the most satisfaction Gator fans have gotten since whenever they last spent an afternoon watching ‘08 Tebow highlights.As much of a shitshow as the Hurd ordeal was, the Volunteer offense is actually in decent shape as far as its 2017 running back situation goes. Starting quarterback Josh Dobbs and running backs Hurd and Alvin Kamara have since bid Knoxville adieu (Dobbs and Kamara are suiting up for NFL teams nowadays), but junior John Kelly is primed to fill in as the new feature back. Despite topping 10 carries just five times last season, the stout speedster broke out to establish himself as the next man up, racking up 630 yards  and reaching paydirt six times. Having stability there will be a much-needed relief for whoever ends up under center.As of Aug. 11, junior Quinten Dormaday and redshirt freshman Jarret Guarantano, who have a combined 39 thrown passes (all Dormaday’s), are battling for the quarterback spot, with Jones keeping a tight seal on which of the two he might be leaning toward for the Sept. 4 season opener. Dormaday was reportedly the favorite heading into camp, per 24/7, but Jones won’t say whether the upperclassman has the upper hand yet or not. AdvertisementWhoever does get the nod will assuredly be throwing a lot of balls to receiver Jauan Jennings, the guy that fucked Georgia all the way up and finished with 40 receptions, 580 yards, and seven scores in 2016. With the incredibly efficient Josh Malone gone, Jennings will be the No. 1 option for the Volunteers; some other guys will also catch balls, but it’s unclear who will actually start or be any good. The Volunteers have sophomore Tyler Byrd, who posted 13 catches and 209 yards last year, as well as redshirt senior Josh Smith (though he’s injured at the moment) and sophomores Brandon Johnson and Marquez Callaway—the trio combined for a whopping 213 yards and two scores last year. Rookie Brandon Johnson has reportedly started to climb the depth chart, too. The reality is that there’s a decent amount of talent here, but none of it has turned up for a full season’s worth of production—you’ll be shocked to know this problem is not unique to the offense.Defensive coordinator Bob Shoop had to deal with a rash of injuries in his first year at Tennessee, resulting in his group becoming the No. 1 reason the team failed to achieve anything meaningful. Heading into his second season, he has to deal with being sued for nearly a million bucks by his old team, Penn State—life’s tough that way, I guess. Personnel-wise, his 2017 defensive line and secondary will be as talented and inexperienced as pretty much every offensive Tennessee position group, as Shoop has to replace 20 combined sacks after losing ends Derek Barnett and Corey Vereen. Redshirt sophomore Darrell Taylor and redshirt junior Jonathan Kongbo should get the job done, and it’ll help that the Volunteers linebacker core will feature a trio of seniors in Elliott Berry, Colton Jumper, and Cortez McDowell. But consistency is not always a recipe for success.While the Tennessee offense hummed for the majority of last season, the defense sucked eggs, giving up 28.8 points per game. If that turns out to not be an aberration, then Shoop will not be long for Knoxville. Ole Butch wasn’t scared to fire John Jancek in 2015 despite the fact the Volunteer ranked 17th in the nation with 20.0 points allowed; if Shoop wants to comfortably pay off that pesky suit, the Volunteer defense had better figure out how to to turn all these dang four-star recruits into, you know, an actual defense.  A Guy To KnowGiven the Volunteers enter the season with a new quarterback, receiving corps, defensive line, and secondary, one of their rare proven entities will unsurprisingly be their best shot at recreating what was at times one of the most entertaining and efficient offensive attacks in the nation. Although  Hurd and Kamara are gone, the Volunteers should rest easy knowing that John Kelly will carry the yeoman’s load in 2017.AdvertisementA three-star recruit out of Michigan, Kelly was never particularly expected to become this season’s feature back with Hurd and Kamara ahead of him on the depth chart. He spent his freshman year on clean-up duty, watching from the sidelines as the duo combined for over 1,900 yards. For the first part of the 2016 campaign, it appeared as though Kelly would serve in the same role, as he didn’t even register a handoff in two of the first seven games. But after Hurd’s transfer and an injury to Kamara forced him into action, Kelly proved to be even more efficient, rushing for 6.4 yards per carry and topping 80 yards four times. At 5-foot-9 and 205 pounds, Kelly is a balanced runner that manages to always keep his momentum headed upfield by mixing in an array of quick side-step moves that allow him to brush off defenders attempting to bring him down without wrapping up. He has inexperience behind him on the depth chart in sophomore Carlin Fils-Aime and incoming four-star recruit Ty Chandler, so barring any surprises from those two, Kelly will be expected to to handle the majority of carries this year; while that may cause concern at other position groups, here, the Volunteers actually got lucky.Can They Make The Playoff?With this weak-ass nonconference schedule, who knows?

Bumi Armada’s share price took a recent beating again, in line with the overall weaker regional markets amid a rise in geopolitical tensions and a spike in oil price volatilities. Fundamentals of the company are intact, nonetheless, as we see this as an opportunity to accumulate Bumi Armada at this juncture. This year will see a boost in earnings from the contributions of four major floating production storage and offloading & floating gas solution contracts.

Quarterly revenue for 2QFY17 came in at RM649.7 million, up 6.09% from RM612.4 million in 1QFY17. O&M remained the largest contributor of revenue, with a 82.9% contribution.

Bumi Armada has allowed oil to be produced from the OML 120 block, Oyo field, off Nigeria by independent oil and gas operator Erin Energy Corp to flow into its wholly-owned floating, production, storage, and offloading vessel (FPSO) Armada Perdana’s cargo tanks.  Even after a series of meetings with Nigeria’s Department of Petroleum Resources and Erin Energy, the latter’s debts are still outstanding. Hence, the oil will not be offloaded from Armada Perdana until a debt resolution has been reached with the stakeholders. While this means that the FPSO operation is still largely suspended, it may mean that there is some progress in the negotiations.  Recall that on June 20 this year, Bumi Armada suspended Armada Perdana’s operations following irregular payments for the operation and maintenance (O&M) services together with long-delayed charter payments involving the OML 120 block, Oyo field, off Nigeria by Erin Energy.  In the first half of this year, two of Bumi Armada’s FPSOs, including Armada Perkasa, were operating in Nigeria, but were only being remunerated for their O&M services since the second quarter of 2016 (2Q16). This was without being compensated for the bareboat charter, which makes up the main bulk of their revenues.  As the outstanding Armada Perdana and Perkasa claims by Bumi Armada have been fully provided for in financial year 2016 (FY16), we estimate a 4% to 5% reduction in forecast earnings for FY17 to FY19 stemming from the loss of O&M revenue recognition from the two Nigerian vessels.  Besides Armada Perdana’s operation in Nigeria, the remaining FPSO operation in Africa is in Angola by Armada Olombendo which achieved first oil on Feb 8 this year.  Even with the full recognition of the massive US$1.5 billion (RM6.43 billion) Armada Olombendo, we remain cautious about the company’s near-term earnings trajectory given the uncertain penalties which could arise from delays in the commencement of the FPSO Kraken’s contract in the North Sea.  Recall that some of Kraken’s undisclosed late delivery provisions were only up to the backstop date of April 1, 2017, which was later extended to July 1 this year. The backstop date gives the client the right to terminate the charter. With penalties potentially accruing at US$6 million a month, negotiations with the client Enquest are still deadlocked.  Given the past earnings disappointment, the group needs to convincingly navigate past its 2QFY17 results to reach its rerating inflection point. — AmInvestment Bank Research, Aug 10",287584269,2017-08-11 02:20:00,"Armada Perdana ops still suspended *** Armada Perdana ops still suspended  The Edge Markets MYFull coverage *** Corporate From The Edge  Armada Perdana ops still suspended  AmInvestment Bank Research  /  The Edge Financial Daily  August 11, 2017 10:20 am MYT  This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on August 11, 2017.  -A  +A  Bumi Armada Bhd  (Aug 10, 69 sen)  Maintain hold recommendation with an unchanged fair value (FV) of 79 sen per share: We have maintained our “hold” recommendation on Bumi Armada Bhd with unchanged forecasts and FV based on a 20% discount to our sum-of-parts valuation of 99 sen per share.

Wall Street put a floor under global equities on Friday after a weak inflation reading brought investors back into U.S. stocks even as tensions between the United States and North Korea continued to escalate, though that tension still drove safe-haven buying of gold and the yen, according to Reuters.

In its strategy report today, the MIDF Research team said the FBM KLCI has been on a gradual uptrend since the beginning of the year, where it almost hit 1,800 points on June 16.  “We reiterate our FBM KLCI 2017 year-end target of 1,830 points, which equates to PER17 of 16.9 times,” MIDF Research said.  In tandem with the rise of the benchmark index, overall market volume also rose more than 30% higher on a year-on-year basis, before trending down sometime in June.  Year-to-date, as of Aug 9, 2017, the benchmark index has gained 8.2% on the back of strong foreign inflows.  “After all, Malaysia is home to the world’s longest bull market,” the report said.  In the near future, the research house said foreign inflows will depend on the geopolitical risks happening around the world.  Amongst other geopolitical factors that affected the market are disputes between Qatar and Arab nations, the launch of the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) by North Korea and Theresa May’s failure in securing majority in the UK snap election.  “We also foresee Malaysia’s inflation to grow moderately for the second half of 2017, given that cost-driven factors are tapering off,” MIDF Research said.  Looking at overall 2017 gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 5.1% and an upbeat exports growth of 14.5%, while also optimistic of the ringgit strengthening to RM4.20 to US$1 by year end, this will bode well in terms of the local market sentiment which could attract foreign funds to Malaysian shores, the report added.  “With the general election looming, we reckon that there is further excitement in store,” MIDF Research said.  To date, Malaysia has outpaced most of its peers in being the beneficiary of net inflow of foreign funds.  Despite Indonesia following closely between March and May, its trend has been on the reverse of late.  “Whilst the numbers have been tapering for Malaysia the past month, we are still in a very strong position, with the cumulative net inflow nearing US$2.5 billion mark,” MIDF Research said.  Amidst the cheer, the research house also highlighted there were noticeable trends of foreign shareholders exiting some of the listed counters.  For example, Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd saw its foreign shareholding level declining by 4.3%, followed by Lafarge Malaysia Bhd, Aeon Co.(M) Bhd and Bumi Armada Bhd, which fell 2.0%, 1.5% and 1.4% respectively.  The research house reckoned these are attributable by the challenging operating climate of companies operating in the media, consumer retail and upstream oil & gas.  Those challenges are facing lower advertising expenditure (adex) numbers, challenging retail landscape and inability to secure long term contracts for its assets, respectively.  “However, it is comforting to know that out of 100 top counters we looked at, only 24 counters recorded a net outflow of foreign funds.  “We remain positive on the following sectors: automotive, aviation, banking, construction, logistics, power and technology,” MIDF Research said.",287584269,2017-08-10 03:49:00,"MIDF Research reiterates FBM KLCI year end target of 1830 *** MIDF Research reiterates FBM KLCI year end target of 1830  The Edge Markets MYFull coverage *** MalaysiaCorporate Top Stories  Highlight  MIDF Research reiterates FBM KLCI year-end target of 1,830  Neily Syafiqah Eusoff  /  theedgemarkets.com  August 10, 2017 11:49 am MYT  -A  +A  KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 10): The local market is expected to be on the uptrend, albeit at a slower climbing pace than that seen during the first half of the year, underpinned by continuous earnings expansion this year and also for the year 2018, according to MIDF Amanah Investment Bank Bhd Research.

Bildet er fra Hydro Karmøy. Foto: Per Thrana  les mer  Nyheter  Finans  Tror Hydro vil tjene på Kina-stenging  Kinas stengning av ulovlige smelteverk fører til økende aluminiumspriser. Arctic Fund Management venter positiv effekt for Hydro og tar aksjen inn i sin portefølje.  Christian Bjerknes  Vil du få varsel hver gang Christian Bjerknes publiserer noe?  Du bestemmer selv hvor ofte, og kan skru av varselet når som  helst.  Ja takk!  Publisert:  14.08.2017  —  20:49  Oppdatert:  14.08.2017  —  20:49  Artikkelen er lagt til i din leseliste.  Kinas produksjon av aluminium falt med 8,2 prosent i juli, ned fra rekordnivået måneden før. Ifølge nyhetsbyrået Reuters skyldes nedgangen kinesiske myndigheters aksjoner mot «ulovlige» smelteverk. Bare i den østlige provinsen Shandong har myndighetene beordret nedstengning av 3,2 millioner tonn med ikke-godkjent kapasitet innen utgangen av juni. Arctic Fund Management mener dette lover godt for Hydro-aksjen.  – Norsk Hydro nyter godt av økende aluminiumspriser som blant annet stiger på bakgrunn av nedstengningen av ulovlig kapasitet i Kina. Kinesiske myndigheter har av miljøhensyn varslet ytterligere reduksjon i produksjonen over vinteren, men dette kan bli vanskelig å gjennomføre i praksis, skriver forvalter Alexander Larstedt Lager i en kommentar til Dagens Næringsliv.  Han tar denne uken Hydro-aksjen inn i Arctics ukeportefølje.  – Med vekst i global etterspørsel og tilnærmet null tilbudsvekst virker markedsbalansen for primæraluminium sterk, sier Lager.  Han påpeker imidlertid at en sterkere norsk krone kan legge en demper på den effekten økte aluminiumsprisene vil ha på inntjeningen i Hydro.  To satser på Orkla Blant meglerhusenes aksjefavoritter finner man denne uken også et annet tradisjonsrikt børslokomotiv. Både Sparebank 1 Markets og Arctic Fund Management tar denne uken merkevareselskapet Orkla inn i sine porteføljer.  – Orkla er betydelig underinvestert i forhold til sammenlignbare selskaper. Vi ser over 20 prosent oppside, samtidig som aksjen har gode defensive egenskaper, skriver analysesjef Lars-Daniel Westby i Sparebank 1 Markets. Han påpeker at Orkla er lavere priset enn sammenlignbare selskaper, og handles med betydelig rabatt.  – Salget av Sapa, samt reinvestering i kjernevirksomheten, vil trekke avkastningen på sysselsatt kapital oppover, noe som bør redusere rabatten, skriver Westby.  Rigger om for Catcher Sparebank 1 Markets tar denne uken Songa Offshore og Avance Gas Holding ut av sin portefølje. I tillegg til Orkla tar meglerhuset inn BW Offshore i sin portefølje.  – Produksjonsstart for Catcher er ventet i løpet av fjerde kvartal og vil medføre en betydelig de-risking av aksjen, skriver Westby.  Han viser til at den flytende produksjonsenheten BW Catcher vil stå for i overkant av 40 prosent av forventet driftsresultat i 2018.  – Selskapet vil da sitte igjen med sterk kontantstrøm og solid balanse etter refinansieringen, og vi forventer derfor en reprising, skriver Westby.  Arctic Fund Management var den store taperen i DNs porteføljekonkurranse i forrige uke. Samtlige av aksjene i porteføljen falt i verdi i løpet av uken, og porteføljen hadde et samlet verdifall på 2,3 prosent for uken.   Alle enige om Golden Ocean Arctic tar denne uken Subsea 7, NRC Group og Atea ut av sin portefølje. – Subsea 7-aksjen har gått svakt, på tross av et driftsresultat for andre kvartal som var 40 prosent bedre enn markedets forventninger.

Arctic Fund Management venter positiv effekt for Hydro og tar aksjen inn i sin portefølje.  Christian Bjerknes  Vil du få varsel hver gang Christian Bjerknes publiserer noe?  Du bestemmer selv hvor ofte, og kan skru av varselet når som  helst.  Ja takk!  Publisert:  14.08.2017  —  20:49  Oppdatert:  14.08.2017  —  20:49  Artikkelen er lagt til i din leseliste.  Kinas produksjon av aluminium falt med 8,2 prosent i juli, ned fra rekordnivået måneden før. Ifølge nyhetsbyrået Reuters skyldes nedgangen kinesiske myndigheters aksjoner mot «ulovlige» smelteverk. Bare i den østlige provinsen Shandong har myndighetene beordret nedstengning av 3,2 millioner tonn med ikke-godkjent kapasitet innen utgangen av juni. Arctic Fund Management mener dette lover godt for Hydro-aksjen.  – Norsk Hydro nyter godt av økende aluminiumspriser som blant annet stiger på bakgrunn av nedstengningen av ulovlig kapasitet i Kina. Kinesiske myndigheter har av miljøhensyn varslet ytterligere reduksjon i produksjonen over vinteren, men dette kan bli vanskelig å gjennomføre i praksis, skriver forvalter Alexander Larstedt Lager i en kommentar til Dagens Næringsliv.  Han tar denne uken Hydro-aksjen inn i Arctics ukeportefølje.  – Med vekst i global etterspørsel og tilnærmet null tilbudsvekst virker markedsbalansen for primæraluminium sterk, sier Lager.  Han påpeker imidlertid at en sterkere norsk krone kan legge en demper på den effekten økte aluminiumsprisene vil ha på inntjeningen i Hydro.  To satser på Orkla Blant meglerhusenes aksjefavoritter finner man denne uken også et annet tradisjonsrikt børslokomotiv. Både Sparebank 1 Markets og Arctic Fund Management tar denne uken merkevareselskapet Orkla inn i sine porteføljer.  – Orkla er betydelig underinvestert i forhold til sammenlignbare selskaper. Vi ser over 20 prosent oppside, samtidig som aksjen har gode defensive egenskaper, skriver analysesjef Lars-Daniel Westby i Sparebank 1 Markets. Han påpeker at Orkla er lavere priset enn sammenlignbare selskaper, og handles med betydelig rabatt.  – Salget av Sapa, samt reinvestering i kjernevirksomheten, vil trekke avkastningen på sysselsatt kapital oppover, noe som bør redusere rabatten, skriver Westby.  Rigger om for Catcher Sparebank 1 Markets tar denne uken Songa Offshore og Avance Gas Holding ut av sin portefølje. I tillegg til Orkla tar meglerhuset inn BW Offshore i sin portefølje.  – Produksjonsstart for Catcher er ventet i løpet av fjerde kvartal og vil medføre en betydelig de-risking av aksjen, skriver Westby.  Han viser til at den flytende produksjonsenheten BW Catcher vil stå for i overkant av 40 prosent av forventet driftsresultat i 2018.  – Selskapet vil da sitte igjen med sterk kontantstrøm og solid balanse etter refinansieringen, og vi forventer derfor en reprising, skriver Westby.  Arctic Fund Management var den store taperen i DNs porteføljekonkurranse i forrige uke. Samtlige av aksjene i porteføljen falt i verdi i løpet av uken, og porteføljen hadde et samlet verdifall på 2,3 prosent for uken.   Alle enige om Golden Ocean Arctic tar denne uken Subsea 7, NRC Group og Atea ut av sin portefølje. – Subsea 7-aksjen har gått svakt, på tross av et driftsresultat for andre kvartal som var 40 prosent bedre enn markedets forventninger. Vi tror fokus har skiftet til selskapets ordrebok for 2018. Vi tror også at noen større aksjonærer sikrer seg gevinst i aksjen, skriver forvalter Alexander Larstedt Lager i Arctic.  Foruten Hydro og Orkla tar Arctic denne uken inn tørrlastrederiet Golden Ocean Group i sin portefølje.   – Vi tar inn Golden Ocean på bakgrunn av stigende capesize shipping-rater.

August 2017  von Julia Kistner  Lernen von den Reichen  © Bild: Getty Images/zorazhuang  Sie ziehen in die Millionärsmetropolen und machen dort selbst ein Vermögen. Reich werden immer mehr Auslandsösterreicher in Asien.  Die Hälfte aller weltweiten Neuzugänge im Club der Millionäre ist in China. Laut Beratergruppe Boston Consulting wird die Zahl der Superreichen bis 2026 im asiatisch-pazifischen Raum fast siebenmal so stark wachsen wie in Europa. So leben in Shanghai bereits nach London und New York City die meisten Multimillionäre mit einem Nettovermögen von über 30 Millionen US-Dollar. Laut Immobilienberater Knight Frank sind dort die Luxusmieten im Vorjahr mit 27,4 Prozent weltweit am stärksten gestiegen, gefolgt von Peking mit 26,8 Prozent.  Erfolgreich mit Chinesisch  Sowohl in Shanghai als auch in Peking gut im Geschäft ist Andreas Laimböck, der die LTL Mandarin School besitzt. Sie ist mit mehr als 10.000 Schülern pro Jahr eine der größten privaten Sprachschulen in China mit Filialen in Shanghai, Peking und der kaiserlichen Sommerresidenz Chengde. Seine Kunden kommen aus der ganzen Welt, vorwiegend aus den USA, Australien, Deutschland, Italien und Frankreich. Wir haben zum Beispiel Daimler-Benz unter Vertrag. Hier unterrichten wir berufsbegleitend. Wir haben aber auch Sommercamps für Kinder ab neun Jahren. Richtig Spaß machen uns die Schüler und Studenten, die anfangs mit Mühe und Not mit Stäbchen essen können und nach einem Jahr besser chinesisch sprechen als ich.  © Privat  Sprachschulenbesitzer Andreas Laimböck  Sein persönlicher Tipp für alle, die in China Karriere machen wollen: Machen Sie sich erst mit der Kultur vertraut, lernen Sie ein Jahr im Einzelunterricht, untergebracht in privaten Familien, perfekt die Sprache und starten Sie dann erst Ihr eigentliches Business. Sie werden deutlich mehr Erfolg haben. Denn 99 Prozent der Chinesen sprechen kein Englisch, und wenn Sie erst in der Arbeit drin sind, geht nichts weiter.  »Wieso sollte ich mit einer Wohnung in Wien vorsorgen, wenn sich das Geld in China viel schneller vermehrt. Die Wohnpreise in Shanghai und Peking sind zuletzt 20 bis 30 Prozent gestiegen«  Chinesisch- und Englischkenntnisse vorausgesetzt, seien die Jobaussichten in Shanghai und Peking gut, das Leben ist nicht günstig, aber man kann hier auch richtig gut Geld verdienen, mehr als in Wien. Und wie sorgt man als Langnase in China vor? Es gibt inzwischen auch in China ein staatliches Rentensystem. Natürlich sorge ich privat vor, aber nicht in Österreich, sondern in China, da wird das Geld mehr wert. Wieso sollte ich mir eine Immobilie in Österreich kaufen, wenn die Wohnpreise in Peking und Shanghai in wenigen Jahren um 20 bis 30 Prozent gestiegen sind?  Big Business in Hongkong  Zum größten Wohlstand außerhalb Österreichs hat es wohl Helmut Sohmen gebracht -in Hongkong, wo die Zahl der Dollarmillionäre laut Weltbank in den vergangenen zehn Jahren um 50 Prozent gestiegen ist und in den nächsten zehn Jahren nochmals um 40 Prozent zunehmen soll. Sohmens Vermögen beläuft sich laut US-Magazin  Forbes auf 1,8 Milliarden Dollar. 1986 übernahm er von seinem Schwiegervater Sir Yue-kong Pao eine Reederei mit 200 Schiffen in Hongkong. Für weiteres Wachstum sorgte Helmut Sohmen 2003 mit dem Zukauf des weltgrößten Gastransporteurs, Bergesen aus Norwegen.  © Getty Images/2015 Yongyuan Dai  Heute ist seine Bergesen Worldwide, kurz: BW Group, mit 161 Tankern und über 4.500 Mitarbeitern eine der größten Reedereien der Welt und an der Börse in Oslo gelistet. Der 77-jährige Sohmen steht seit 2014 nicht mehr auf der Kommandobrücke. Er hat das Ruder an seinen in Singapur lebenden Sohn Andreas Sohmen-Pao übergeben. Dessen jüngster Deal: der Einstieg der BW Group mit 30 Prozent beim in New York gelisteten Öltanker-Riesen DHT.  © Privat  Geht es der Flotte der Reederfamilie Sohmen gut, geht es der Konjunktur gut. Andreas Sohmen jun. investiert in die Konkurrenz und in Ölfelder  Der 47-jährige Sohmen junior ist mit Millioneninvestitionen im afrikanischen Staat Gabun auch ins Offshore-Ölfördergeschäft eingestiegen. Was man von den Sohmens lernen kann: Man kann sich nicht auf seinen Lorbeeren ausruhen, muss viel investieren und riskieren und sich auch gut vernetzen. Andreas Sohmen-Pao ist Vorsitzender der politisch mächtigen Singapore Maritime Foundation. Sein Vater Helmut Sohmen saß in Hongkong auch schon im Parlament.  In Singapur geht die Post ab  Auch in Singapur findet man Millionäre an jeder Ecke. Der Stadtstaat gilt als sicher und stabil. Viele Reiche lassen hier ihr Vermögen verwalten und nicht mehr in der Schweiz. Die Offshore-Veranlagungen werden in Singapur bis 2021 um acht Prozent pro Jahr zulegen, rechnen die Berater von Boston Consulting. Weltweit sind sie 2016 um vier Prozent auf 10,3 Billionen Euro gestiegen. In Singapur geht dank eines Grazers aber nicht nur in der Finanzbranche die Post ab: Von Oktober 2011 bis Juni 2016 war Wolfgang Baier Chef der Singpost, des nationalen Postunternehmens des asiatischen Staates.  © Getty Images/2014 Bloomberg Finance LP  Im Vorjahr wechselte der Sohn einer steirischen Postlerfamilie an die Spitze des Beauty-Logistikkonzerns Luxasia mit Sitz in Singapur und wurde dort auch Aktionär. Luxasia bringt Topmarken wie Ferrari oder Calvin Klein nach Asien und vertreibt sie. Wie bei so vielen stand bei Wolfgang Baier am Anfang seiner Auslandskarriere ein Beraterjob. Nach seinem Doppeldoktorat in Wirtschaft und Recht heuerte er beim Beratungsunternehmen McKinsey an, das ihn zur Singpost entsendete.  © Privat  Der Grazer Wolfgang Baier vertreibt in Asien von Singapur aus mit dem Kosmetiklogistiker Luxasia Topkosmetikmarken  Dicke Luft und dickes Geld in Peking  So schlecht die Luft in Peking auch ist, sie ist noch nicht zu dünn für Millionäre und Multimillionäre. Peking ist laut Beratungsunternehmen Knight Frank die vor Dubai am stärksten wachsende Stadt. Zwischen 2015 bis 2020 soll die Bevölkerung der 28-Millionen-Metropole noch um 18,7 Prozent steigen. Die Dynamik ist es, die auch die erfolgreichen Auslandsösterreicher in Peking fasziniert, so auch die österreichische Marketingexpertin Barbara Seidelmann, die es nach ihrem Wirtschaftsstudium in Wien nach Peking zog: Ich bin in Wien mit chinesischen Nachbarn aufgewachsen und hatte früh einen Zugang zur chinesischen Kultur. Ich habe recherchiert, welche Unternehmen in China ansässig sind, und noch während meines Studiums und eines 40-Stunden-Jobs 200 Bewerbungen nach Peking, Shanghai, Taipeh und Singapur geschickt. Geworden ist es ein sechsmonatiges Praktikum und eine anschließende Anstellung bei Siemens in China.  © Getty Images/dukai@2015  2008 bekam sie den Job als Managerin für die Region Asien für den Schmuckproduzenten Frey Wille. 2012 gründete sie in Peking dann ihre eigene Firma 5 Star Plus Retail Design &Consulting, die zwölf Mitarbeiter vollzeit-und zehn teilzeitbeschäftigt und Topmarken in China vermarktet und Vertriebs-und Shopkonzepte entwickelt. Zu ihren internationalen Kunden zählen Swatch, Ivanka Trump Jewelry, Nordica, Österreich Werbung oder auch Wirtschaftskammern von Österreich über Großbritannien bis Australien. Warum ihr Geschäft in China so brummt: In ein paar Jahren wird es in China 200 Städte geben, die mehr als eine Million Einwohner haben. Entsprechend groß ist der Wettbewerb. Marken, die hier Kunden anwerben wollen, müssen um einiges kreativer und besser sein und mit ihren Shops und Marketingaktivitäten einen Wow-Effekt erzielen, um wahrgenommen zu werden.  »Die Mieten in Peking sind extrem hoch. Man kann aber auch deutlich mehr verdienen«  Man spüre, dass sich in Peking mehr Hightech-Betriebe ansiedeln und sich in China auch eine eigene Hightech-Szene breitmacht. Das bestätigt auch das Reichen-Ranking des US-Magazins Forbes: In der Liste der vermögendsten Menschen der Welt mit Tech-Bezug mischen erstmals zwei Chinesen unter den Top Ten mit, darunter Alibaba-Gründer Jack Ma mit einem Kontostand von 28,3 Milliarden Dollar.  © Privat  Barbara Seidelmann Unternehmerin  Wird mehr verdient, wird das Leben automatisch teurer. In Peking sind die Mieten extrem hoch, sagt Unternehmerin Barbara Seidelmann. Auf der anderen Seite sind die Steuerbelastung sowie die Kosten für Essen und Lebensmittel um einiges geringer. Wenn man entsprechend plant, kann man in China um einiges mehr auf die Seite legen als in Österreich.  Modisches Tokio  Alles spricht von den Hotspots in China. Ein solcher ist aber nach wie vor auch Japans Hauptstadt Tokio, wo der Preise pro Quadratmeter Wohnraum bei 10.900 US-Dollar liegt und die Topmodelabels dieser Welt nach wie vor gute Geschäfte machen. So auch die Modedesignerin Edwina Hörl aus Wien, die ihr Tokio-Ticket 1991 mit dem ersten Österreichischen Modepreis des Bundeskanzleramts für Kunst und Kultur bekam. Sie startete in Japans Modemetropole mit einem Arbeitsstipendium bei Yohji Yamamoto durch. Hörl staffiert heute unter anderem die international bekannte Songschreiberin Leslie Feist aus, ihre Mode ist in Japan in Dutzenden Shops vertreten.  © Getty Images/Michael Hitoshi  Was macht Erfolg in der Ferne aus?Es geht mir nicht nur darum, immer wieder neue Kollektionen zu designen, sondern auch Bezug zu nehmen auf gesellschaftliche und soziopolitische Fragestellungen und Stellung zu beziehen. So gibt es für jede Kollektion ein Konzept, ein Thema, das in begleitenden Texten nachzulesen ist und durch Bilder visualisiert wird. Ansonsten heißt es hart arbeiten und ständig an qualitative Verbesserung denken. Immer so perfekt wie möglich sein. Die Termine einhalten und besser früher liefern als später. Guter Kontakt zu den Leuten, die im Showroom arbeiten, die die Kollektionen vertreiben und auch den Kontakt zu den Einkäufern pflegen.  »Alles, was reinkommt, wird sofort wieder in eine neue Kollektion oder Projekte investiert«  Japanisch-Kenntnisse und ein fettes Startkapital wären natürlich zu empfehlen. Da kann ich nur sagen: ,ganbatte-durchhalten! Denn das Leben in Tokio ist nicht ganz so günstig. Ja, Tokio ist ein teurer Ort. Vor allem die Mieten. Man lebt einfach in kleineren oder engeren Räumen als in Österreich um das gleiche Geld. Geht auch, weil man hier einfach anders wohnt und diese Wohnflächen keine Repräsentationsräume sein müssen. Und wie sorgt sie für sich vor? Jedenfalls nicht an der Tokioter Börse: Alles, was reinkommt, wird sofort wieder in eine neue Kollektion oder Projekte investiert.  © Privat  Die Überlebensphilosophie von Österreichs Modedesignerin Edwina Hörl in Tokio  Hat sie sich je überlegt, wieder nach Österreich zurückzukehren? Nein, habe ich mir nie überlegt, entgegnet Hörl entschlossen, nachdem ich die Möglichkeiten in Japan kennengelernt habe, wäre es schwierig, mit der zur Verfügung stehenden Infrastruktur in Österreich zurechtzukommen.

August 2017  von Julia Kistner  Lernen von den Reichen  © Bild: Getty Images/zorazhuang  Sie ziehen in die Millionärsmetropolen und machen dort selbst ein Vermögen. Reich werden immer mehr Auslandsösterreicher in Asien.  Die Hälfte aller weltweiten Neuzugänge im Club der Millionäre ist in China. Laut Beratergruppe Boston Consulting wird die Zahl der Superreichen bis 2026 im asiatisch-pazifischen Raum fast siebenmal so stark wachsen wie in Europa. So leben in Shanghai bereits nach London und New York City die meisten Multimillionäre mit einem Nettovermögen von über 30 Millionen US-Dollar. Laut Immobilienberater Knight Frank sind dort die Luxusmieten im Vorjahr mit 27,4 Prozent weltweit am stärksten gestiegen, gefolgt von Peking mit 26,8 Prozent.  Erfolgreich mit Chinesisch  Sowohl in Shanghai als auch in Peking gut im Geschäft ist Andreas Laimböck, der die LTL Mandarin School besitzt. Sie ist mit mehr als 10.000 Schülern pro Jahr eine der größten privaten Sprachschulen in China mit Filialen in Shanghai, Peking und der kaiserlichen Sommerresidenz Chengde. Seine Kunden kommen aus der ganzen Welt, vorwiegend aus den USA, Australien, Deutschland, Italien und Frankreich. Wir haben zum Beispiel Daimler-Benz unter Vertrag. Hier unterrichten wir berufsbegleitend. Wir haben aber auch Sommercamps für Kinder ab neun Jahren. Richtig Spaß machen uns die Schüler und Studenten, die anfangs mit Mühe und Not mit Stäbchen essen können und nach einem Jahr besser chinesisch sprechen als ich.  © Privat  Sprachschulenbesitzer Andreas Laimböck  Sein persönlicher Tipp für alle, die in China Karriere machen wollen: Machen Sie sich erst mit der Kultur vertraut, lernen Sie ein Jahr im Einzelunterricht, untergebracht in privaten Familien, perfekt die Sprache und starten Sie dann erst Ihr eigentliches Business. Sie werden deutlich mehr Erfolg haben. Denn 99 Prozent der Chinesen sprechen kein Englisch, und wenn Sie erst in der Arbeit drin sind, geht nichts weiter.  »Wieso sollte ich mit einer Wohnung in Wien vorsorgen, wenn sich das Geld in China viel schneller vermehrt. Die Wohnpreise in Shanghai und Peking sind zuletzt 20 bis 30 Prozent gestiegen«  Chinesisch- und Englischkenntnisse vorausgesetzt, seien die Jobaussichten in Shanghai und Peking gut, das Leben ist nicht günstig, aber man kann hier auch richtig gut Geld verdienen, mehr als in Wien. Und wie sorgt man als Langnase in China vor? Es gibt inzwischen auch in China ein staatliches Rentensystem. Natürlich sorge ich privat vor, aber nicht in Österreich, sondern in China, da wird das Geld mehr wert.
